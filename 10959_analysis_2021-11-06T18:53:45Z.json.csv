It's a good morning at Rivertown Insurance. I'm Katie. What can I do for you today?,I need to check my balance.
Ok. I can help with that. On which account?,#Oh. My car insurance.
Ok. I can pull up your account with your name and birthdate.,Ok. It's Angie Thorndale.
#Mhm.,"And, my birthdate is October twenty four two thousand two."
"Ok, Angie, would your account be under Angela instead of.","Yes. Yeah, sorry. Angela."
"No problem. I see your account and now I'll need to verify it by, asking your security question.",Sure. Fire away.
What is the name of your childhood best friend?,Larry.
Ok. Thanks for that.,#Mhm.
"Ok, Angie, it looks like you have monthly automatic payments. Was there a problem with a payment going through?","#Oh. No, I was just wondering that if the balance for the rest of the six months wasn't too high, that I would pay it all now."
"Ok. That's possible, but keep in mind that if you change to bi-annual billing and you want the billing to go back to monthly at the beginning of your policy renewal, that you'd need to call back.","#Oh. So, I can't just pay the balance and have you keep it that way? Wouldn't the system just not bill me if the balance is zero?"
#Hm. Good question. Give me a second to talk with my supervisor about it and let me find the easiest way for this to happen.,Ok. Thanks.
Sure. One moment.,#Mhm.
Angie?,"#Mhm, I'm here."
"My supervisor said it's fine if you just paid the balance, then the system would just not pull a payment if the monthly balance is zero. Then, the renewal will automatically go to the default payment frequency. Make sense?","Yeah, that's what I was hoping."
Great. Give me a moment while I get this going.,"Wait, I need the balance before I decide."
"#Oh, jeez. Yes, sorry. It's been a long day.",No problem at all. I totally get it.
"Thanks. #Um, it looks like the balance remaining is two thirty seven fourty eight.",Ok.
"Now, that's three months with the five percent discount for automatic payments and electronic billing.",#Yep. Great. Let's do it then.
Ok. One moment.,#Mhm.
"Ok, would you like me to use the card on file?","Yes, please."
Can you please verify the last four digits of the card?,"Yes, it's three one two eight."
Perfect. Give me one second to complete the payment.,#Mhm.
"Ok, Angie, that's taken care of and I see your policy will renew September first.",Great. Thanks.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?,"No, that's it. Thanks."
"Very good. Thanks, again, for calling Rivertown Insurance. I hope you have a good rest of your day.","Thanks, you, too. Take care."
Thanks. Good bye.,Bye bye.
