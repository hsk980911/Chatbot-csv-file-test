"Good morning, Rivertown Insurance, this is Maggie.","Yeah, hello? I just need some info."
"Yes, I can help you with any questions. How may I help you today?","#Uh, I was just calling-calling about insurance?"
"Yes, we offer several kinds of-.","Yeah, I just need it for my apartment."
I can help you with that! We offer two different renter's insurance policies-.,"#Uh, I just want to know your cheapest one."
"#Um, well, we have two policies. Renter's Basic and Renter's Preferred. Renter's Basic covers theft of personal belongings and is offered at the low cost of three hundred dollars per year.","Well, I don't know-I don't know if I'll be here a full year? I only got like six months on my contract. I might renew, but I don't know. It just depends, you know."
"I completely understand! We do offer six-month periods for the equivalent cost, so it would be one hundred fifty for six months.",What if-what if I end up leaving early?
Unfortunately we would not be able to refund you for amount of time left on-left on the insurance.,The insurance?
"I mean, apartment. The amount of time left on the apartment. Sorry.","Oh, yeah. I understand. Okay. #Um, so would this, like, protect against any kind of, water damage to my stuff?"
"Well, it would only protect belongings lost due to the unfortunate event of theft. For water and insect damage we offer Renter's Preferred.","Oh, man. Bugs? I didn't even think about bugs. I'm here for school-do they, do they get a lot of bugs here?"
"#Um, I can't tell you whether your aparment will have bugs. But I can tell you that I have had claims for bug damage before.",From this state?
"#Uh, yes. We only offer insurance here in Utah.","Oh, man. Okay. I hate bugs. #Um, so what is-what is the price difference between the cheap one and the other bug one?"
Our Renter's Preferred policy costs three hundred a year.,"Wait, I thought that was the basic one?"
"Oh! I guess I-I guess I messed up. . Sorry about that. Renter's Basic is two hundred, so one hundred for six months, and Renter's Preferred is three hundred, so that's the one fifty we talked about. Sorry again for the mix-up.","Oh, great! No problem! I was already sold on the-on the one fifty thing so I guess we should just go with the bug one."
"It also covers if like, your pipes bust and damage your property.","Oh yeah. That'd be good because I've got people over me, and I don't know, you know?"
"Absolutely! Better to be prepared, right?","Yeah. So, how soon can I set this up?"
We can set up an account for you over the phone right now if you'd like. I'd just need a few pieces of information for you.,"Yeah, I can do it now."
"Great! First of all, can I get your name?","Yeah, the name is Alex Freeley. That's f-r-e-e-l-e-y."
"Thanks for the information, Alex. Can I get your date of birth, social security number and preferred phone number, please?","Oh, okay. I guess you'd need-all that, right? Okay. My birthday is January nineteenth, two thousand two. And what else did you need? My phone?"

Oh sure! We can do that. Do you want your bill sent by email as well? We offer auto-pay.,"#Um, on second thought. Maybe I should-I should just do mail? I don't know."

Great. What's a good email for you?,"Uh, it's a-l-e-x-s-k-a-t-e-c-a-t at one two three dot com."
"So, alexskatecat at one two three dot com?","Yeah, that's the one."
"Great! Okay. I think-I think we have it all set up, Alex. You will be receiving some forms within three to five business days which will ask you to make a record of all the items you would like insured under the policy. It will ask you include pictures and will include information on how to upload that information online. Does that work for you?","Oh yeah, that works. I don't have a lot of stuff, I just, you know. Worry about my drums mostly. And like, my computer?"
