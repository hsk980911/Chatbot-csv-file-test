Good morning. Rivertown Insurance. This is Jessica. How can I help you today?,"Hi! Yeah, I, wanted to ask about your, apartment insurance."
"Certainly! Are you looking to cover the property, or are you a renter?","#Um, I'm, I will be renting."
"OK, so we're looking at renters insurance. I can definitely help you with that! We have a few different coverage options that.","Does it, like, matter if I haven't, found a place yet? Because I, like, submitted some, rental applications to, like, three places."
"It's fine! You don't need to have an apartment just yet. We can, look at some different policies and see what you need. And generally we would set the start date for your first day on the lease, or your move-in date.","Cool! So, OK, like, me and my friend are getting a place together, so, like, would we, or could we, share a policy?"
"We generally advise against that unless you're, living with a spouse or partner or family member, someone who you might have shared possessions with.","Oh, so I should, like, have her call you, too. OK, yeah."
"We can definitely help her, too. Keep in mind, though, that you'll wanna check to see what your landlord requires or, requests. Most landlords want you to have insurance, but the specific coverage, like who is covered for what, is up to them to decide, since there's no law.","OK. So we've, like, got it narrowed down to three places. We, like, spent two weeks looking."
Sounds fun! Let me pull up some numbers on my computer. Just a second. So will you be going to school?,"Yeah. We're both sophomores. We lived on campus last year so this is, like, our first apartment."
How exciting! What dorm were you in?,I was in Jacobsen.
"I was, too! Eighth floor. Great views of the mountains.","Yeah, totally! I was, like, on the second floor but used to, like, hang out up- up on the sixth."
"Good times! So I've got some numbers here, and there are different things.","Cool, thanks!"
"That are included and, excluded. And, I'm sorry! Can I get your name?",Becky.
"Hi, Becky! Nice to meet you. Or, talk to you! .",Hi! .
"So there are some things for you to keep in mind. First of all, do you or, will you have a car?","no. We're- we'll, like, walk."
Good! That makes it easier! Vehicles aren't covered. And any exotic animals?,"We might, like, get a cat. #Uh, it depends on which apartment."
"They're fine! Insurance excludes things like snakes, some dog beads, breeds. And a lot of apartments ban them anyway, so it's not a an issue, but we do get a lot of questions.",But cats are OK?
"Yep, kitties are fine! I mean if they, cause damage, it's covered. Unless there's some sort of super-human, I mean, super-kitty level of damage damage.","No! We, like, my family's cat, like, totally shredded the curtains. But I'll get a good little kitty! ."
"Of course! So some other things that are usually excluded are floods and I mean damage to your belongings caused by floods or earthquakes. Your landlord might have policies to cover the building, but your personal belongings wouldn't be included.","#Um, OK. So."
"So those are the exclusions. Basically most other things are covered. #Uh I mean damage to your belongings due to other things. So, like, fire, oh, there's one other exclusion. #Uh bed bugs.",Ewww! .
"Yeah, yuck! I hope the places you're looking at don't have them!","Oh my god, yeah! Gross! ."
"So yeah, other than that, you're covered for things like fire, theft, personal liability, like if someone has an accident in your apartment.",Like at a party or something? Or like if my parents visit?
"Yeah, if they get hurt. And things like if your apartment is deemed uninhabitable and you need to stay at a hotel or motel, that's covered.",OK.
"And if there's a power outage, like a storm or just a- an outage and your food spoils, it's covered.","OK, "
"Yeah, so basically your personal belongings and loss to them, or of them, and injuries to guests.","OK. So, like, how much, how much do I need?"
So there are a few different plans depending on the value of your possessions.,"Wait, so do I, like, have to know how much all my stuff costs? Do I have to, like, have proof or something? Like receipts or something?"
"Oh, no! I mean, not for everything. I know that would be a challenge. Especially for personal or sentimental stuff.","Yeah, like, I don't even know!"
"I do recommend taking a, an inventory of your stuff. And write it down and make your best estimate. Generally a furnished one-bedroom apartment, that includes the furniture, the clothes, the food in the refrigerator, basically everything. It might all total fifteen thousand.","Fifteen thousand? I don't have anything! I, like, lived in the dorms last year!"
So we can scale that number down. You can estimate how much you might spend on furniture.,"OK, yeah. I'm, I mean we're - wait, what if me and my roommate, like, split the cost, like if we buy a sofa or something together?"
You could add half the cost to the estimated value of your belongings.,"OK, OK, yeah."
"So, yeah, take an inventory of your stuff, and then make your best estimate about the stuff you'll be buying. And we have a couple of tiers of coverage. So if you don't think you've got fifteen thousand dollars worth of stuff, the next level down would cover ten thousand. And remember, with things like clothes, shoes, food- the cost of having a fully-stocked kitchen does add up.","OK. But yeah, maybe not fifteen thousand."
"So the annual premium for that plan would be, let me see. Give me just a second here. Three hundred and eighteen dollars. That's if you pay annually. It's thirty four dollars per month if you pay monthly.","OK. But, like, what happens if I like do go over ten thousand? Like if I have more stuff than that, and then something happens?"
"Well, if you do file a claim, like if something happens, up to ten thousand dollars worth of belongings would be covered, like we would reimburse you for their cost, but anything beyond that wouldn't.","OK. And what is the, the amount, sorry, I don't remember what it's called, but, like, the amount that I have to pay first?"
"The deductible! So for the quote I gave you, the deductible is five hundred dollars. There is a lower deductible, there's one that's two hundred, but then the premium goes up to three hundred and seventy four dollars.","OK. Yeah, maybe the lower, I mean, the three eighteen is better. And what if I, or we, or I guess even just me, what if I move? Like, would I lose my coverage? Would I, like, have to pay to keep it?"
"Oh, no! The policy would follow you to your new apartment or house.","Cool! Cause, yeah, I dunno, maybe we'll decide we, like, really want a cat but the place doesn't allow it."
"Yep, you could move and get a cat! .","Cool! So, how long do I have to decide? Because we're, like, still looking and probably won't, move until, you know, like right before classes start."
"That's no problem! I can send you this quote, with some general information about renter's insurance. Just reminders and stuff, like what is and isn't covered and some general tips. So I can send it to you, and remember that you don't need it and, really shouldn't get it until your move-in date. Just make sure that the date on the policy starts on your move-in, or on the first day of your lease.","OK, yeah!"
"So Becky, can I get your last name?",It's Braithwyle. That's b. r. a. i. t. h. w. y. l. e.
Braithwyle. And your email?,It's Rebeccah Braithwyle at smithson university dot edu. Rebeccah with an H. R. e. b. e. c. c. a. h.
"Got it, thanks! So I'll just send this out to you.",Thanks!
"And I've included both of the policies- I mean both of the levels of coverage. Oh, wait! Sorry, I had one other question for you. Or one other caution, really.",Yeah?
"Anything like really fancy, or really expensive jewelry- We, we recommend additional coverage just for those, for each individual item.","Oh, yeah, no. Nothing, I mean, nothing special or expensive. I mean, yeah, like, I have, like necklaces and stuff that I got as like birthday presents and stuff, but no, they're not like fancy or anything."
"OK, excellent! So the two different plans, the different levels of coverage should be good for whatever you've got to cover. Anything in your apartment.","Cool, thanks!"
You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?,"No, I think I'm good."
