"Alright. And just for future reference, theres a way to pay your bill online at our website.","Hi, yes, I'm calling today Id like to pay my bill. I always pay the same day my rent is due."
"Thats fine, sir. Could I just have your name?",I don't use the Internet. It doesn't make sense to me.
"Thats a very unique first name, sir.",It's Jem Mae.
"Very funny, sir. And do you spell your first name g. e. m.?","Yeah. My mother picked it, not me. She spelled it funny."
Your last name isn't spelled like the month? #Er May?,"Not like that. You spell it j. e. m. My last names spelled different than you think, too."
Just a few more pieces of information to verify it's you thats calling. What then is your birthday?,"No, it's spelled m. a. e."
So your name is Mae but instead you were actually well you were born in June.,"It's June seventh, nineteen sixty-four."
Could I have your phone number?,The ironies of life.
"So six one four, seven two three, three zero five seven?","Yeah, it's six one four, seven two three, three zero three seven. #Er no, the last four numbers are three zero five seven."
And now your social security number.,"Right, thats it."
You could alternately provide your customer number. It's on your bill near the top.,What do you need that for?
"Yes, thats right, sir.",I don't see it anywhere. It says customer number next to it?
Then I'm going to need your social security number.,It's not on here.
Are you in a public place? I can see why that might be a concern for you.,I don't like giving out my social security number over the phone.
Is there somewhere you could go where you could safely give me a place youd be able to safely share that number?,"No, I'm in my apartment, but people can hear going by."
"Just to verify that was five one seven eight, one three, five oh nine?","I don't think they can hear me in my closet. Give me a second. Ok, so it's five one seven, eight one, three five oh nine."
"Ok, and then I need your answer to your security question. What is your best friends name?","Yeah, thats it. Oh, this window! I really need to get in there and clean this sometime. Maybe when I."
Absolutely right. I wondered about that. That would be a strange name for a person. But I'm sure it suits your cat.,"My best friend? Oh, I know. I put my cat. His name is mister Gigglebottoms."
"It's a very funny joke, sir. Ive got your account pulled up. For future reference, you can set up auto billing so you don't have to call every month. It would automatically bill your credit card at the same time every month.",Hes a good cat. I named him that as a joke.
"Well, you receive an email telling you that your card has been billed.",How am I going to keep track of it if I don't call every time?
Thats right. You did say that. I apologize.,"But I told you, I don't get on the Internet."
"Ok, and what is the bills invoice number?",And I just want to pay this months bill. Not that continuing basis like you were saying.
It's a six digit number followed by a dash and then three digits. It should be near the top of the bill.,I'm looking on here and I don't see anything marked invoice.
Just to verify thats five one seven one two three dash four four nine?,I don't see oh there it is. It's five one seven one two three dash four four nine.
"Ok then, sir. Ill need your credit card number and CVV.","Yeah, thats right."
"Take your time, sir.","Ok, it's a Mastercard. The number is, let me see here, where did I?"
And the day it expires with the security code?,"Ah, I found it. It's seven one two four, six seven two seven, three five one five, four two seven eight."
"Alright, Ive got that entered for you. The next time your payment is due will be August first.",It expires May twenty twenty-two. The code thing is six seven seven.
Well thank you for doing business with Massive Dynamic. Enjoy the rest of your day.,Right. Ill call again when that rolls around.
Goodbye.,"Yeah, ok. Goodbye."
