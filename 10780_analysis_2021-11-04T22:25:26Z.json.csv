agent,customer
Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?,Yes I've heard a lot of good things about you guys from friends and family and I was interested in finding a local agent to talk about signing up for one of your plans.
I'd be more than happy to assist you with that. May I have your first and last name please?,It's Karen Graves.
"Thank you, Karen. What type of policy were you interested in?",What all kinds do you have?
We have a multitude of products from life insurance to pet insurance to automobile insurance.,Oh okay. I thought you guys just did auto insurance.
No ma'am we actually have a whole range of products to meet your needs.,Well that sounds great.
Which ones were you interested in?,Well I don't have a pet and I'm not too happy with my life insurance policy right now.
So you would like to have an agent call you about life and auto? Is that correct?,Yeah let's see what they can do.
Okay. We can definitely do that. How would you prefer to be contacted? Phone or email?,Well. Let me go ahead and give you both that way if I can't answer the phone they can email me.
"Okay. That sounds good. What's a good phone number for you, Karen?",It's eight five zero nine two one one two three four.
Perfect. And your email?,Hang on and let me get it. My granddaughter writes all this stuff down for me. I really don't know what I'd do without her .
Well I'm glad she's able to help you out.,Yes she really is a blessing. Do you have any grandkids?
No ma'am. I don't.,Well maybe one day!
Maybe so! Did you get your email?,Yes. It is karen dot graves dot twenty nine at gmail dot com.
Okay. And you spell your name k. a. r. i. n.?,No it's k. a. r. e. n.
Oh sorry about that!,That's okay. It's a common mistake.
Perfect. What time of day is usually the best time for an agent to reach out to you?,Oh well I guess sometime in the afternoon is fine.
Would about two o' clock tomorrow afternoon work for you?,Is that Central Time?
Yes ma'am.,Then yes that would be fine with me.
Perfect. I'll schedule it with the agent closest to your address to reach out to you.,Great. How long does it usually take to get everything all set up?
Well it just really depends on what all you're interested in getting. I would set aside maybe an hour at most to speak with them.,Oh okay. That's not so bad.
No ma'am not at all.,And they'll call the number I gave you?
Yes ma'am.,Okay great.
"Was there anything else I could do for you today, Karen?",No I think that's all.
Perfect. There will be a brief survey after the call. Do you mind staying on the line to tell us how your experience was?,I can do that.
Perfect. It'll start as soon as I disconnect.,Okay.
Have a great day! Goodbye.,Bye.
