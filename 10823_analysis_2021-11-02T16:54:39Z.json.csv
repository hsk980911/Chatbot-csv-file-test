"Good morning, thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. This is Savannah, how may I help today?",Good morning! I just needed to add a person to my policy?
"I can assist with that. May I have your full name and date of birth, please?","Yes, my name is Rae Fielder. My birthday is August tenth nineteen-seventeen nine."
"Thanks for verifying that, miss Fielder. Do you happen to have your policy number handy?","#Uh, no, but I can find a statement real quick. Is that alright?"
Sure. We could also verify social security number and phone number if that's easier.,"I know I have the billing statement right here, I just need to look for just a second."
"Oh, okay. No problem. You may also want to consider online billing? Not so many papers to keep track of.","Okay, I found the statement! #Um, I'm not interested in online billing right now. I'd rather have a hard copy for my insurance bill."
"Sure, no problem. Okay, what's you-what's your policy number.",Let me see here. It looks like it's nine-eight-seven-six-.
Uh-huh.,Four-two-four-five.
"Okay, thanks for verifying your policy, miss Fielder. First of all, I want to thank you for being a loyal customer with us for the past five years. We really appreciate your business.","Oh, yeah. Sure."
I see you have both Home Complete and Preferred Auto policies with us?,"Yes, that's right. I just needed to add my daughter to the auto insurance as a driver."
"Well, did she just get her license?",Yes we're all both excited and scared.
"Yeah, that's a big change for sure.","No kidding. She's my first driver, so it's been a very different experience."
"I bet. I remember when I first started driving. Stay of the sidewalks, right? .","Well, I wouldn't go that far. My daughter, Lily, is very responsible."
I'm glad to hear that. You don't always get that with teens.,"Yes, we're very lucky. Straight A student too. Planning on finishing an associate's degree by the time she-she's done with high school."
"Oh, wow! That's awesome.","Yeah, we'll keep her ."
"So, as your daughter is sixteen and a first time driver.",Uh-huh.
This will increase your rates a bit.,"Well, I expected an increase. How much more will it cost?"
"#Um, let's put her in the system and see. What's her full name?",Lily Anne Fielder.
Is that L-i-l-y and A-n-n?,"Yes, on Lily, but the Anne has an e on the end."
"Great, got it. And what's Anne's date of birth?","September twenty-first, two thousand and five."
"Okay, great. And you mentioned she does well in school?","Yes, she's an honor's student."
Have her keep her report cards. Rivertown actually decreases the amount by fifteen dollars each six months for good student rewards.,"Oh, great! Every little bit helps, right?"
That's for sure. Okay-so right now you're paying fifteen hundred for our Preferred Auto coverage which provides both comprehensive and collision-.,"Yes, I'm aware of our coverage. Sorry, I'm just kind of in a hurry."
"I understand, ma'am. No problem.","Great, so how much will it cost to add Lily?"
"Being a beginning driver, it looks like, it will be an additional fifteen hundred to insure Lily on your current plan.",What?
"This price is typical for all insurance agencies, we acutally provice one of the more generous coverage options for beginning drivers at a competitive price.",I had no idea.
"Well, if it helps, we can change your billing so it's monthly instead of bi-annual? This way it gives you a smaller amount to pay each month instead of a lump cost of fifteen hundred every six months?",Hold on-I just need to process for a moment.
"#Uh, yeah, no problem.","So, so will it be. #Um, is there any way to -."
Reduce the coverage?,Yes! Reduce the coverage. Yes.
"Well, you are currently on our mid-tier policy which offers both-.","Yes, I understand what it offers. Is there a simpler one?"
"#Um, our Basic Auto is only five hundred a year? But it only offers collision? And it's a higher deductible.","So, a five hundred dollar difference?"
Yes. Without the great benefits of our-.,And would Lily's decrease by five hundred as well?
"Unfortunately, new drivers will cost that fifteen hundred no matter what coverage you're on.","#Oh. It's just how it is, I guess?"
Exactly.,"Okay. Well. I guess, we have to do what we have to do."
"So, add your daughter to the current Preferred Auto policy?",Yes. Please.
Great! Let's just get a few more details.,Okay.
"Just to confirm, the automobile we currently have on file for you is the two-thousand seventeen Nissan Pathfinder?",Correct.
And do you have a driver's license number?,"Yes, one minute. Lily! Lily! Bring me your license."
If she isn't there-.,"She's here. Okay, yeah-she's getting it right now."
"Okay, that's great.","Alright, the number is six-five-five-four-two-three-one-one."
Six-five-five--four-two-three-one-one?,Yes. That's it.
"Okay, great. Thanks for that information. It looks like your next payment will be due on August thirty first, but we can add Lily now by either, paying for the time until the new billing cycle starts, or-.","Yes, let's just do that. And then the mailed bill will come at the regular time?"
That's right.,"Okay. So, what do you need for me to pay for now?"
I will need a credit card number or we could also do a single checking account withdrawal.,Let's do credit card.
