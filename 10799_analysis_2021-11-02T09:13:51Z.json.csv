Rivertown Insurance. This is Amanda speaking.,"Hi, there Amanda. This is Jason Reynolds. I'm needing some assistance."
Of course. How can I help?,"I'm moving, and need to update my address."
"Yeah, sure. Let's get your account updated. May I have your name one more time?",Jason Reynolds. R-e-y-n-o-l-d-s.
Thank you. I have a friends that's a Reynolds.,Is that so?
"Yeah, Suzy? Suzy Reynolds?","I don't know a Suzy, maybe a long-lost cousin?"
"Maybe. Kinda a common name, right?","#Uh, yes. Yes-there are quite a few of us."
"Okay, let's see here. May I get your birthday and policy number?",Which one would you like first?
Let's do policy number.,Got it right here.
Great.,It's three-three-four-five-six-seven-seven-seven.
"Yeah, let's see here. #Um, that's not pulling anything up? Could you maybe- repeat that again?",Yes. Certainly. It's three-three-four-five-six-seven-seven-seven.
There we go! Must have hit something wrong the first time. Great. And now just verify the birthday?,"November first, nineteen seventy."
"Thank you for verifying all that. Now, let's see here. You said you needed to update an address?","Yes, ma'am."
"Okay, so no more Laurel Avenue?",That's right. Time to move on.
And what should I put down for your new address?,It's four-four-six-nine Elm Street?
"Oh! So your changing a laurel for an elm, huh? .","Yep, that sounds about right."
Okay. And what's the rest of the address?,"So it's four-four-six nine Elm Street, that's in Utah of course. City is Midvale. And zip is eight-four-six-two-zero."
Okay. Looks like we have everything updated!,Wonderful! Thanks for your help.
"So, mister Reynolds? It says here that you have pet insurance with us?","Yes, that's right."
"I was wondering, have you ever considered our home, auto or life insurance policies? It could save you a bit of money if you have combined services with us.","Well. #Uh, currently we have Progressive? And we've had a hard time finding any other place that's as competitive with rates."
I understand that. But it might be worth your time getting a quote? It wouldn't take very long.,"#Um, I really am on my way out right now? But is there anyway I could call back later?"
"Oh, yeah. We're here Monday throught Friday from six to eight at night.",No weekends?
"#Uh, we have people for emergencies? Like for claimiss But not our, regular customer service. But you could get a quote online at our website?",Really? That's a nice perk.
"Yes, we have an online chat set up for customers. Are you currently set up with an online account?","No, no I'm not. Unless my wife has set one up? Let me ask her real quick."
Sure. I'll hold.,"No, it looks like we haven't set up an online account."
It's super simple. I'd just verify the email we have on file for your and send you a link. The link has all the info you'll need to set up your account.,Okay. Let's go ahead and do that. I'm more likely to have time on the weekends.
"And a nice thing is that you do a lot of things on your account? Like, you could have updated your address there, or your phone, or like, make a claim. Lots of things. Or if you get another pet?","Well, yes. This sounds like just the thing. So you just need to verify my email?"
"Yes, your email please.",Our email is reynoldsfam at one two three dot com.
Thanks for verifying that email for me.,No problem.
You'll be receiving that link in your inbox within the next fifteen minutes. Just go ahead and activate your account within the next twenty-four hours or the link will expire.,Okay. The next twenty-four hours.
"Yeah. And for any reason you miss the time limit, just give us a quick call back and we'll send you another one.",Wonderful! Sounds like a plan.
Okay. Well you have a good day now.,You too. Oh! I almost forgot.
Yes?,"My wife was wanting to ask, is it possible to change our billing frequency?"
Let me take a quick look at what's set up right now.,I think it's monthly? I was wondering if there were different options?
"Yes. We offer monthly, like you have now. Or we have bi-annually or annually.","And remind me, what's the coverage cost for a full year?"
Looks like our Pet Preferred is a thousand dollars a year.,That sounds about right.
Are you interested in getting things changed?,Is this something I could do online?
"Yes, you can change billing frequency online.",One moment. My wife's saying something.
"Oh, yeah. No problem.",She says go ahead and change it to bi-annually.
I should change it now?,Is that okay?
"Yes, of course! Okay, let me just navigate to the right screen here.",Thanks. Sorry for all the trouble.
Not at all! No problem. I'm glad we have time to make these changes for you.,Seems suspicious that I have time for this but not for a quote .
"Oh, no. I get it. Sometimes it's easier to do things like that online. I totally understand.","Well, thank you."
"Okay. I'm just going to go ahead and change your billing frequency to bi-annual. That will be five hundred due on, let's see here, it take a minute for the computer to update.",Sure.
"Okay, it looks like it will be due on September first?","Yes, we're getting close, aren't we?"
Where did the summer go!,I was just saying the same thing this morning. Better start soaking up the sun.
"No kidding. Okay, so just to recap. We changed your address-.",Yep.
"Sent a link for online account access, and we also changed your billing frequency to bi-annual payments of five-hundred dollars. And your billing preference is still bill by mail, correct?","Yes, that sounds right."
Are you interested in autopay?,"No, I took up too much time already. I'll think about that one."
"Sounds good, mister Reynolds. Thanks so much for calling in today. Hope you have a good one.",Thanks for everything. You have a great weekend as well.
Will do!,Bye for now.
