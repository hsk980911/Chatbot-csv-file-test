"Alright, excellent. It should come up in just a moment here.","Yeah, I was actually just checking what date my coverage ended but I realized I had completely forgotten my password so I figured I would just call."
"Oh, if you need any assitance after we take care of your password issue I would be more than happy to assist.",Okay yeah.
"Alright your account finally loaded up, I apologize our computers are being very slow today.",It's alright.
I just need to ask you a few security questions to confirm your identity so we can fix your password.,Okay.
And these are all based on the information you gave us when you set up your account.,Right.
"Okay, so I'll start then. The first question is what street did you grow up on?",Elm street.

That's a good name for a dog.,He was a great dog.
So this is the final question. What was your mothers maiden name?,Astley. A S T L E Y.

Okay good. So. I'd also like to confirm is the d dot k dot ennis at gmail dot com email address still your prreffered contact method?,"Yes, that is my primary email account."
Good. So what I can do is send a password reset link to your email.,Okay.
and that link is good for two four hours.,Okay.
"So you can go to your email sometime in the next day or so, click on that link in the email, and it will walk you through the steps to reset your password.",Oh okay. So I guess I can't just get you to change it?
"No, for security reasons we aren't allowed to do that ourselves.",Oh for security reasons.
"Yeah, we aren't even given access to that part of the account.","Oh I guess that makes sense, because I would just be telling you my password."

Yes. Was there eanything else you needed help with?,Yes I wanted to look up the date when my insurance runs out.
"Alright, just hold on for a moment. it looks like the end date on your policy is September third twenty twenty one.",September third alright.
Would you like to extend your coverage past that point?,I was thinking about it.

And is there anything else I can do for you today?,no so I don't think so. Thank you very much for your help today.
