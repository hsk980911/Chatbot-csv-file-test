agent,customer
This is Sarah at Rivertown Insurance. I hope you're having a great day! How can I help make it better?,This is Steve Blaney. I'm calling to cancel my auto insurance plan.
"I'm so sorry we might lose you as a customer, mister Blaney. Let me pull up your account. Do you have your eight digit account number?","Yes. It's seven two four one eight three six two. I also have my car policy number if that helps. Seventeen hundred, thirty-six, forty-eight."
"Oh, thank you for both of those. Ah, yes. I have your plan in front of me. We do value your business, mister Blaney. May I ask why you want to cancel your policy with us?",I found a cheaper premium with another company.
"I see. So, you're currently signed up for our complete auto plan at a price of two thousand dollars per year. And you've found a less expensive plan with someone else?",Yes. A much cheaper plan. Thirteen fifty a year.
That does seem to be a good deal. Now will your plan with another company be a complete plan as well or are you dropping down to a basic plan?,"Well, I guess it's the same plan. The benefits looked to be the same according to this new agent."
"I just wanted to confirm that because it can get confusing and I, in fact, just got off the phone with a customer that found a cheaper plan with another provider. But after looking at the new policy with him, we found he was not going to get the same level of benefits. I just want to make sure that doesn't happen to you. As I said, your plan is our complete plan, which includes the six most common car insurance options of auto liability coverage, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, comprehensive coverage, collision coverage, medical payments coverage and personal injury protection. But in addition you get coverage for rental reimbursement, gap coverage, new car replacement coverage, towing and labor cost coverage, ride-sharing coverage, sound system coverage and classic insurance coverage for your nineteen seventy-five Chevrolet Monte Carlo.","Oh, I sold that car last year. And I have triple A coverage so I don't need towing coverage. Probably not half of that other stuff."
"That's probably why this new offer is so much less expensive. We have a price-match policy if you have an offer of the same coverage for less. Also, if you drop your car insurance with us, you'll lose your multi-policy discount for having your homeowner's insurance with us as well. In the long run, it would definitely be worth us doing an apples to apples examination of our plan versus theirs to make sure you're not going to miss out on other benefits.","Look, I'm just going to be honest with you. My son-in-law has started selling insurance and we're just trying to help him out. He didn't mention anything about them offering homeowner's insurance."
It might be that they only offer car insurance.,"Hmm, I didn't think about the multi-discount thing."
"I think it's great that you're trying to help your son-in-law out, mister Blaney. As I said, we'd hate to lose you as a customer, but I really want to make sure you're not losing any needed coverage or benefits by changing plans.","Well, that's - I appreciate that. You've always been good to work with."
"What I'd like to recommend, if you're open to it, is that I set up an appointment with Joe Black, your agent, so he can take a look at the new policy you're considering and help you accurately compare the options. You may find that it is best to go with your son-in-law, but it sounds like we might be able to take you down to a Preferred Plan or possibly even a Basic Plan and keep you with a multi-policy discount.","Jeez. You're making a lot of good points that I didn't think of. I do want to help my son-in-law as much as I can, but -"
"If your son-in-law is new to this, meeting with Joe about what you're considering might help you to even go back to your son-in-law with questions so he can learn some new aspects. Ultimately both he and we at All Rivers want what is best for you. It's your choice in the end.","What you're saying makes sense. My son-in-law can learn and so can I, which it sounds like I need."
It can't hurt. Learning is always a good thing! So can I set up a time for you to meet with Joe? How soon were you wanting to get this done by?,"Uh, sooner versus later."
Joe has an opening tomorrow at four p.m. or Friday at nine a.m. Would either of those work for you?,Let's do Friday. Gives me an excuse to take the whole day off then. 
That's the best part! A day off. A day off and getting you the best and most appropriate deal for you.,I like that. I think I'm worth it.
"I have no doubts, mister Blaney.",Now do I need to go to Joe's office? He's not coming to my house is he?
"He might be able to come to your house, if you prefer, but those times I gave you are his office times.",That's fine. I'll go to his office. Is he still at the corner of James and Harrison Streets?
"Let me look that up for you. One moment, please.",Sure.
Actually Joe moved his office last year. He's now at six two six Cranberry Drive.,"Oh, wow! Cranberry Drive is just down the road from me. That's great!"
"Well, good I'm glad that worked out.","Me, too."
"So just to summarize and confirm. I have you meeting with Joe Black at his office at six two six Cranberry Drive at nine a.m. on Friday, July sixteenth. Please bring the new policy you're considering with you, or a list of what is covered, included.",Will do.
I made a note in your file for Joe to talk with you about the Basic and Preferred Plans to see if they might be sufficient for you now.,Thank you. I forgot all about notifying him that I sold the Monte Carlo.
That's understandable there's a lot going on in the world and our lives these days.,You've got that right.
"Is there anything else I can help out with today, mister Blaney?","No, I think, that's everything. I really do appreciate your time to think this through."
"Like I said, we want what's best for you, and of course, we certainly hope we retain your - we keep you as a customer. A happy customer.","Well, you've made a good first step at that."
"Well, thank you. If there's nothing else, I'll disconnect our call now. And you have a wonderful rest of your day, sir.",You as well. Thanks again.
"Good-bye, mister Blaney. It was a pleasure to speak with you.","You, too. Bye-bye."
