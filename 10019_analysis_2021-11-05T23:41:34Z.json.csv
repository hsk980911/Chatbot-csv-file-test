agent,customer
Good morning. Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. My name is Susan how may I help you?,"Hi Susan, my name is Jane. I need to add a dependent to my insurance plan."
"Ok Susan. I can take care of that for you. First, may I get your full name and policy number?","Yep, my full name is Susan Jones and let me see here there it is. My policy number is three six two nine nine eight seven."
"Thank you susan. I'll just pull up your file, please hold a moment.",Okay.
"Alright, I have your file here. You want to add a dependant to you policy? Is that correct?","Yes, we just had a baby, so I need to get her added to the plan"
Congratulations! a boy or a girl?,A girl! we were hoping for a girl. As you can see we've had three boys. Rolled the dice one last time and won! 
"Well, she'll have lots of big brothers to watch out for her.",I'm sure she'll end up ruling the roost.
"Okay Susan, lets get her added, we'll start with her name.","Sure, her full name is Stevie Lynne Jones."
Could you spell that for me?,Yep s. t. e. v. i. e. middle name l.y. n. n. e. and Jones conventional spelling on that j. o. n. e. s.
"Stevie for a girl, that's unusual.","Yeah, we are big Stevie Nicks fans "
"Okay, and her birthdate?",July one st twenty twenty-one.
"Alright then, so she will be enrolled on your plan as of her birthdate. With the same coverages.",Perfect. Thank you. Will there be an increase in the premium?
"No, you already have the Family Coverage, once you had the first child, your premiums don't increase with additional child dependants.","Okay, good. I knew there wasn't an increase for the boys, but I wasn't sure how many we could add before we jumped up to being a big family or something like that."
"I'd say you're definitely a big family now, but there are no limits on how big you get.",I think we're done.
So the paperwork will be submitted today and you'll receive the documents by email. Is sjones at gmail dot com still the correct email address?,"Yep, that's the one."
Great. Thank you. You will receive her identy card in the next week or so with her ID number. If you need to use the plan before you receive the card just use your card. There is a one month grace period for that.,"Okay, I wondered, good. She has a checkup next Tuesday."
No problem at all. The coverage will be in place.,Good. Okay. I think that's it then? Do you need any more information?
Let me just quickly check everything. One moment.,Okay
"While I have you on the phone, I'll just confirm you're at the same address. I have you at one two five Grand Street, Summervill PA. Is that correct?",Yep. still there.
and your zipcode is seven seven four nine three eight?,"oh? jeez, no. It's seven seven four nine three six. Has that been wrong all this time? I never noticed on the mail, it always seemed to get here."
I'll change that right now. I'm surprised the mail got there too.,"Thank you, I'm glad you checked that."
"Okay, that's all changed.","Okay, any other details?"
"I'll just confirm your phone number, and that should be it.","No problem. three oh five eight eight four nine six two seven. That's my mobile number, we've cancelled the land line a few years ago."
"Yes, that's the one I have. So that's it. All done. Did you have any questions?",Nope. I'm good. Thanks for your help.
