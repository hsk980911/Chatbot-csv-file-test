"Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance, how may I help you today?",Hello hi there are you a machine?
No sir.,Oh okay.
I am a human being.,"Okay that's great thank you, sorry, I just-you know-I just wanted to talk to a real person instead of a robot or something."
"That's alright I perfectly understand, how may I help you today?",I need to I need to cancel my health insurance.
"Iokay, we're sorry to see you go but I can help you with that. First I need to verify your identity in order to access your account, okay?",Okay.
"Okay, so in order to do that I need your full name, your date of birth, and your eight digit customer account number.",My customer account number?
"Yes sir, it should be on any piece of correspondence we've sent you, near the top of the page.","Oh okay I see it. Yes my name is Lawrence Keeler, and my date of birth is oh six one one sixty seven."
That's oh six one one you said?,"Yes, correct. Sixty seven."
Alright.,And then my customer number is is seven six seven.
"Alright, okay.",Two three six six four.
"Okay. Good, alright I'm in your account now. And you said you watned to cancel your plan today?",That's right.
"Well, we are sorry to see you go. May I ask what is the reason for canceling your plan?",I signed up for the health benefits at work.
"Oh okay good, you will still have insurance then.",Yeah that's right.
"I'm sure you've looked over all of the different choices available, but have you considered switching to different plan with us?",Mhm.
We several different plans with very competitive rates and benefits.,
"And I notice you have a legacy cutomer discount applied to your account, which would transfer over to a different plan.",Oh really?
Yes sir.,I didn't know that.
"Yes, it's because the discount is applied to your account instead of your plan.",Oh okay.
So it applies to any plan that Rivertown offers. And since that discount is acrued if you disable your account it will disappear.,"I see, I didn't realize that."
But also it will- the that also means that discount will get larger and larger as long as you continue to have an account with us.,I didn't know it worked that way.
"Yeah, it's a little bit complicated to be honest.",Yeah I think I got a thing in the mail about this big when I first got that .
"Oh yep, they would have mailed something too I'm sure.","But either way, the plan with work is what I want so "
You're gonna stick with canceling this plan and switching to your work's health insurance?,That's right yeah.
"Okay that's great, obviously you can come back at anytime, there's not a penalty or anything like that.",Okay.
"For coming back, and if it's for the same account they may even throw the discount back in.",Oh okay .
In fact let me just write a note here about that.,Okay thank you I suppose.
"No problem, just my job. Okay, so we're cancelling your health insurance plan today and the way that works is since you've already been billed for this month.",Uh-huh.
Is that we will continue our coverage until the end of the month. So your last date of coverage with us will be the thirty-first of May.,Okay that doesn't make any conflicts or anything.
No there shouldn't be any problems with the plans overlapping or anything.,Okay good.
It only becomes a problem if someone tries to bill both agencies for the same work or something like that.,Oh I see. Because that would be fraud?
Yes exactly. That's a common scam.,"Oh, I didn't realize."
Yep but normally we don't have any other problems with the effective dates of plans overlapping.,Okay good. Yeah I'm not trying to scam people so.
yeah nothing to worry about then.,Not much to worry about that's right.
Okay so I have that set up in your account and was there anything else I could help you with tonight mister Keeler?,no I don't think so. Thank you very much for your help.
Okay and before you go would you be willing to take a brief customer satisfaction survey?,I don't really have time right now.
I could send it to your email for you to complete later? It's just a survey on what your experience was as a customer of Rivertown Insurance. Just sort of something we use to see if we could do better in the future.,Okay yeah alright send it to my email that sounds fine.
"Okay, I just sent it to your primary email on file.",Okay good.
And I I think that's it. Did you have anything else you.,"Nope that's it yeah, thanks."
"Well then, thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance, hope you have a wonderful day.",Yep.
