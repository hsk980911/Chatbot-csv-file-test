agent,customer
Good morning and thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. This is Jack.,"#Ah, hello?"
Hi. How may I help you?,"I was-I was just wondering. If it was possible. #Um, I'd like to get a homeowner's quote?"
"I can help you with that, sir.","Now, before we get going."
Yes?,I'm not going to give you any of my information?
Your information?,"Yes. No last name, no social security, no nothing. I just want a quote. I don't want to give you my phone number-."
"#Oh, I understand sir.",I don't want to be put on any list. I don't want people calling me afterwards and bullying me to buy their insurance-.
"I-I understand, sir. I can give you a basic quote on insurance, sure. No calls or anything. I won't even ask your name if you're not comfortable.",Because I'm having a problem with the spam.
"I understand, sir.","I received three calls-three calls about a car I thought about buying the other day. I wasn't even looking in earnest! I was just, you know, checking things out."
"Yeah, just keeping an eye out.","Exactly! And now my phone just rings and rings. Well, it doesn't ring, but it plays some song that came with it. Over and over again. Driving me crazy."
"I bet. That's, frustrating.","I tried blocking them, but somehow they have two lines and just tried with a different number! Tried to shave a hundred dollars off the price if I came back in. Why not just give me the price it's worth? Why?"
"No, no. I hear you. Just offer the price and no haggling, right?","Right! And so before we start, talking insurance. I've gotta know. Are you going to harrass me?"
"No, sir. I can give you a basic quote, and you can choose to get more details at a later time. If you-if you want.","Okay, then. Give it to me."
The information?,"Yes, whatever spiel you've got. Go for it."
"Well, we offer three different tiers of homeowner's insurance. You buy, not rent?",That's right. We aren't renters. Thank goodness.
"Okay. #Um, so there's three types that we offer-.",Uh-huh.
"Basic Home, Home Preferred, and Home Complete.","Okay. Well, that tells me nothing. What's the difference."
"Yes, I can go into some detail there, sir.",Okay. That'd be nice.
"So, as you probably already know, since you have a home-.",Uh-huh.
"#Um, so all of our policies cover, damage to the exterior and interior of the house-.",Yeah.
And just listing the things here so I don't miss anything-.,"Yep, go right ahead."
Liability for if anyone is harmed on your property-.,Now what?
"So, like, if kid is walking on your fence-.",Uh-huh.
And falls off into your rose bush. He could -his parents could try suing you-.,For my rose bush?
Maybe a better example would be if someone slipped on your driveway?,Oh. Never thought about that. They could sue?
"Yes, sir. Sadly, I've seen it happen.","Okay. Well, glad that all the rates cover that."
Yes. So the main difference between our rates are how you are paid if there's any problems.,"So, what's the difference?"
"Our Basic Home covers what they call actual cash value? That means we pay what item are after their, depreciation.",Cause it's old stuff?
Exactly. Like a fifteen year old couch won't be replaced at the same amount as a new couch.,"Well, that's common sense."
And our Home Preferred plan would pay the actual cost of damage to your home or items without the depreciation.,Oh!
So you'd be able to rebuild your home and belongings at the actual price you had insured them for.,Oh. Yeah. That one sounds good.
"Yes, it's great coverage, sir.",And there's still a last one?
"Yes. So our last offering, Home Complete-.","Yeah, that sounds good."
Our Home Complete covers the cost of your home even if it exceeds what you initially quoted it for.,I don't understand-.
"So, let's say it cost two-hundred thousand to build your home.",Seems fair.
And it burnt down.,Okay.
"But now, say, the price of lumber went up? So if we used the same amount of money it took to build it initially-.",It wouldn't be enough.
Exactly. Home complete covers the property with up to a twenty five percent of the limit.,Oh. Wow. I bet that one's expensive.
"Well, I think you'd find our policies very competitive. Especially if you ultimately decide to bundle your auto with us.",Huh. Already have auto with you.
"Well, you're looking at a ten percent savings annually if you choose your auto and home insurance with us.","Huh. Well, let's talk numbers."
"Sure, sure. Are you sure you don't want to pull up your account and take a look-.",No. I told you-no calling. Don't you call me.
"Oh no! I won't be calling you, sir. I just thought-.",I just ant to hear some numbers. Need to run everything past the wife.
"Understood. Okay, so our Basic Home policy costs twelve-hundred a year-.",Uh-huh.
Our Home Preferred-.,"That's the one where it doesn't discount it being old, right?"
That's right. Depreciation isn't figured in when it comes to replacement.,So what's that one?
Our Home Preferred is sixteen-hundred a year.,"Hm. So, only a four hundred dollar difference?"
"That's right, sir.",And that last one?
Home Complete is two-thousand annually.,"Huh. Well. I mean, that's not too bad."
"#Um, so, I guess you'll be talking to your wife? Remember that we can bill monthly, bi-annually or annually-.","Yeah, yeah. I get all that. Okay. Gotta go. Thanks for the info."
"Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. Please don't hesitate to call back if, -.","Yeah, yeah. If we decide to do it I'll give you a ring. Good day for now."
"Thanks for calling, sir.",Yep.
