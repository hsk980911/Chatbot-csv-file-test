"Hello, Rivertown Insurance, Rocky speaking.","Hi, my names Kitty."
Thats a very unusual name.,"Oh, well, it's actually Cate, but my friends all call me Kitty."
"What can I do for you, Cate?",I want to sign up for a the health insurance plan you offer. It's time to take better care of myself.
"Id be glad to do that for you, Cate. Are you an existing customer with us?","No, I'm new. Ive never yeah."
"All right. We have to set up an account for you, then we can go ahead with getting you your health insurance.",So what do you need?
"I need your full name, of course, a good number to reach you at and your social security number. Well also create a security question for you.","All right. My name is Cate Ballentine. You can reach me here, at five one seven, three three two, four one seven five."
"Great! And can I get your social security number, please?","Sure. It's three seven two, eight one, two zero four zero."
Lot of zeroes in that one.,I never really noticed.
"And now a security question. Ill read you your choices, you pick one you want to answer.",Ok.
So here are three you can choose from What high school did you attend? What is the name of your first school? What was the make of your first car?,I can tell you my high school was Hudson High. That Ill remember.
Great! Let me just enter that and your account with us will be all set up. Ok. So you wanted health insurance with us?,"Yes, what are the details if surrounding health insurance with you?"
"Well, lets start here. When would you like the health insurance to start? Immediately or at some time down the road?","Immediately, I think."
"Ok, and now which of these do you feel is most important for your plan? Hospitalization, preventative care, dental, vision, telehealth or coverage for existing conditions?",Existing conditions would be something I want to look into. But I also need I do need a good dental plan.
Are you currently enrolled in Medicare parts A or B?,No.
And when were you born?,"February tenth, nineteen sixty-four."
Are you a smoker?,"No, yuck on that stuff."
You may get a better rate with us because of that.,"Oh, thats great. I'm glad I quit."
Do you want to include a spouse in this plan?,"No, this is only for me. I'm on my own."
What about dependants? Any children to insure?,"No, I don't have any kids. As I say, I'm on my own."
And what is your address?,"I live in Ravenna, Ohio. At six fourty Grove Street."
And what's your household income?,"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
It's the only way to get the best plan for you. I do apologize.,I make about sixteen thousand dollars a year. Give or take.
"And finally, what is your pre-existing condition?",I have diabetes.
What we have available for you is called the Choice Advantage Plan. It has discount dental and vision. It includes telehealth and Heightened Care for your dental. That gives you a fifteen percent discount on any visit to the dentist.,I could use that.
Your office visits would have a co-pay of forty dollars per visit up to a maximum of three.,And what does that cost me?
"It depends on what you want your deductible to be. For a thousand dollar deductible, itd be three hundred fifty-nine dollars and seventy-nine cents a month. You could opt for a higher deductible of two thousand five hundred dollars. That would run two hundred seventy-two dollars a month.",What's the highest deductable I can have?
"The highest deductable would be seven thousand five hundred dollars, and that would set you back only two hundred and twenty dollars a month.",I think I want to go with that last one. I'm pretty healthy overall.
Sounds good to me.,What about getting my insulin?
There are no particular benefits covering that with this plan.,I guess Ill have to take what I can get. Is that the cheapest plan you have available?
"No, we have our HPG Choice plan. The conditions for that are a little different.",What are they?
"Well, it's one hundred sixty-four dollars and ninety-five cents a month.",#Ah I like the sound of that!
"Instead of deductibles, the plan pays you a flat rate in each case.",Like what do you mean by that?
"So, for a hospital stay, the plan pays out a thousand dollars per day.",That isn't much for a hospitalization.
"Thats true. But it's for an unlimited number of days. However long youd need to stay, youd have that amount of money coming every day.",What if I have to have surgery?
The plan would pay twenty-five thousand dollars toward any surgery.,What if I needed more than one?
"I'm afraid it tops out at twenty-five thousand. If you need multiple surgeries at the same time, thats what the plan would offer.",I'm not entirely comfortable with that. Does it have anything for the insulin?
"For the insulin, lets see here. It says here that is, I see that for the first twelve months, there would be no coverage available. After that you would get forty dollars toward it for a brand name insulin, and ten dollars if you chose generic.","Thats something, at least."
And you would have full coverage on any telehealth needs you had.,What about the dental. You didn't mention you didn't say anything about that yet.
You would get twenty dollars and twenty cents toward any dental you had.,"Well, it's not a plan I love, but it's the one I can afford."
Would you like me to enroll you in that plan today then?,Id like you to change the American health system so I'm not paying through the nose for something I need to live.
"#Ah, ok. Thats a little beyond the scope of what I can do for you. I'm sorry.","I know it is. Yeah, go ahead and sign me up for the hundred sixty-four dollar plan."
Right. Well get you right into the HPG Choice Plan right now.,"So todays date, July thirtieth, twenty twenty-one, you are enrolled in the HPG Choice Plan. How would you like to pay for that?"
Credit card I assume is the only way.,"It's the easiest, yes."
All right. Let me go get my card. Ill be back in a second. Hello? I'm back.,Go ahead anytime you're ready.
"My card number is three one seven five, two zero four zero, eight one nine three, two one six two.",And the date of expiration as well as the security code?
It expires in June of twenty twenty-five.,And the code?
Oh right. It's two one one.,"Ok, you are now covered under our HPG Choice Plan. I hope that will let you sleep a little better tonight."
Lets hope.,Is there anything else I can do for you this day?
"No, I think that about does it. Thanks for doing this for me.",No problem. Have a pleasant afternoon.
