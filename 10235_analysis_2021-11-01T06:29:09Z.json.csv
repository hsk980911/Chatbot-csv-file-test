"Hello Rivertown Insurance John speaking, how can I help you?",Yes hi I was calling to get a quote for life insurance please oh and to check on the status of my auto insurance.
Sure no problem I can take care of that for you.,"Thanks. What information do you need from me? Account number, policy number."
Let's start with account number.,Alright I have it right here it's.
Hold on just a second ma'am I need to get into the correct screen on my computer.,Oh I'm sorry.
It's okay it will take just a second. Alright I'm there so go ahead please.,Okay my account number is seven four three.
seven four three.,nine one six.
nine one six. Okay so I do see that you have an auto insurance account and what information did you need for that?,I wanted to see how much more I owe on my policy.
Okay let me check on that for you.,Thanks.
Okay so it looks like you are halfway through your policy but you paid in full at the beginning of your policy.,Oh really?
so you're yes ma'am so you're.,I'm all set then?
"Yes, you're all set.","Okay perfect, so that's taken care of then."
Yes you're all paid up on your auto insurance.,Great.
And I see that you already have a life insurance policy on your account as well.,Oh really?
Yes ma'am you have a term life insurance plan with us that was started at the beginning of the year.,Was that paid in full because I don't think I pay anything monthly for it.
Yes ma'am it was paid in full at the beginning of the year.,What month was that?
The policy started and was paid for in February.,m okay and it's in my name?
It's for Miranda Fawkes.,#yep that's me alright m I don't even remember that but that's okay alright so I already have one.
Yes ma'am.,Okay and you said it's the basic plan?
Yes that's correct. It's called the term life insurance plan.,And is that your most basic plan?
Yes ma'am that's correct.,Okay then let me get a quote from the other plans then if you don't mind.
I don't mind at all. We have two other plans the whole and universal.,And what are those prices for those?
The whole life insurance is eighteen hundred for the month and the universal is twenty two hundred.,Wow that's quite a jump from what I paid if I'm correct.
Yes the term is three hundred a year.,Why is it so much more expensive the other two?
Because they offer a lot more coverage and cover more situations. They also pay out a lot more.,Oh okay I get it. So someone will be more tempted to knock me off .
Oh #jeez I hope not .,Me neither but I'm just teasing. So yeah I think I want to go with well what's the differnce between the two? Like coverage wise?
The main difference is what money gets paid out. But the universal plan also has some extra coverage too.,Like what?
Well the whole life insurance is pretty comprehensive but doesn't cover you if you are traveling while the univeral one does.,ha okay.
And the universal plan comes with more payout.,"Alright. Well I do travel but not like a lot. However, if I was traveling and something happened to me I know I would be covered."
Exactly. I usually don't recommend the universal plan to people who don't travel unless they want and bigger payout for their beneficiary but if people do travel even a little I usually suggest this plan.,Oh really?
#yep because people don't realize how tricky things can get if something happens to you in a foreign country.,Yeah I guess I never thought about that.
Yeah I've dealt with some horror stories or rather heard some horror stories from people I know in the claims department.,#wow #jeez okay well then I should probably get the universal one then.
I mean it's up to you but I personally would go with the universal plan if it was me.,Yeah no totally I understand and I think I do as well.
Okay.,So how much is that plan again?
It's twenty two hundred for the year.,And the whole plan was eighteen hundred?
Yes ma'am.,So that's only four hundred more then and will give me piece of mind.
Absolutely.,so I think I'll go with that one then.
Alright great so you would like to change to the universal plan then?,No I want to go ahead and keep my term life insurance but add a universal plan since I already paid for the term insurance.
Oh right okay. So do you want the same beneficiaries and everything?,who actually is the beneficiary on the term plan?
let's see it's Tyler Haines.,Oh yes that's my son so yeah let's keep him as the beneficiary then.
Okay no problem.,Can you just transfer all of that information over or do I need to give you all of his info again? I am remembering signing up for the term insurance now and the process of that.
No no I can just transfer all of his information. So what I'm gonna do is just open another policy for you and then you can choose to pay monthly or the whole policy upfront.,Oh okay.
But we will need at least one payment today.,Okay so let's do this one monthly since it's quite a bit more expensive.
"Alright and I have a Visa debit card on file, do you want to pay monthly with that card?","Yes please, that comes straight out of my checking account so that's good then."
Alright so I'll add a monthly payment then to that card.,How much does that come out to every month.
It will be about one hundred and eighty four dollars.,Alright that's manageable.
Okay so you're all set then. You should get a confirmation by email and in the mail soon. Can I help you with anything else?,Nope I think I'm all good. Thank you very much for your help!
No problem. Have a great day.,You as well.
Thank you. Goodbye.,Goodbye now.
