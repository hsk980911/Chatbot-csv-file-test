"Rivertown Insurance, this is Greg, how can I help you?","Dude, you gotta help me!"
"Alright, what's going on?","Oh man, I can't even believe this is happening. I just bought this car!"
"Uh oh, what happened?","I guess I wasn't paying attention. I had some friends in the car with me. I didn't even see the stop sign, dude."
Sounds like you've been in an accident. How can I help?,"I'm freaking out, man. I can't think."
"Okay, just take a couple deep breaths. We'll get you through this.",I can't find that card anywhere! It should be in the glove box. But now I'm not even sure I put it in there. What if I forgot?
Are we talking about your insurance card?,"Yeah, man. The guy I hit. He's so mad!"
"Okay, I can help you with this. What's your name?","What? Oh, it's Shane."
"Alright Shane, what is your last name?",Andrews.
"Okay, let's get your policy pulled up. Can you tell me your birthdate?","Oh man, the cops are here now. This isn't good."
"Sir, can I have your birth date?","What? Yeah, okay. Um, September seventeenth."
"Alright, September seventeenth. What year?",Ninety nine.
"Okay, so that's nineteen ninety nine. I'm pulling up your policy now.",Oh geez. This is bad.
Can you verify your address for me?,"I live on Kingston Street. Uh, fourteen forty."
"Okay, fourteen forty Kingston Street. City and state?",Avondale Arizona.
The zip?,Uh. Eight five two three five.
"Thanks. Alright, hang on a second while I pull this up.","Okay. Oh man, I can't believe this."
"Okay, I've got your policy pulled up here. Do you need me to email it to you?",I don't know. How does this work?
"Well, you're going to need your policy information to give to the police and the other driver.",Okay.
Do you have access to your email on your phone?,Yeah.
Great! So I can just email you a copy of your policy for you to show the police.,They don't need it on paper?
It should be okay for you to give them your policy information.,"Okay. Thanks, man."
No problem.,I don't know how any of this works. I'm so stressed out!
"I can imagine! Listen, I need to get your email address. I don't have it on file.","Okay, it's Shane A four two five at gmail dot com."
"Alright, I have Shane, s.h.a.n.e A at gmail dot com.",Yeah.
"Okay, I'm sending that over now. Do you want to check and make sure you got it?","Okay, yeah, just a minute. Let me put you on speaker."
Okay. Take your time.,"Okay, I got it."
Great! So that should be all the information you need to give to the police and the other driver.,"Thanks, man."
No problem. Now you'll need to call in your claim for the accident. Do you know the number for that?,Claim? What do you mean?
"So, whenever you get into an accident, you have to call the insurance claim line.","Oh, I didn't know that. I've never been in an accident before."
"No problem. Tell you what, hang on here. I'm going to email you some information about claims.",Really? That would be awesome.
It will tell you everything you need to do.,Wow. Thats great.
Is there anything else I can help you with?,"No, man, but thanks."
No problem. I hope your day gets better!,Me too!
"Alright, goodbye.",Goodbye.
