agent,customer
Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. My name is Allison and I work in the claims department. Did you need to open a claim today?,"Hi, yeah. I have renters insurance with you guys."
"Ok. Let me get your policy number, do you have that?",Yes. I have it right here.
Go ahead.,It's nine zero one eight two three seven four five zero.
Nine zero one eight two three seven four five zero?,Yes.
Thank you. Can you please verify your account by answering one of your security questions?,Sure.
What is the name of your high school?,"Yeah, it's Meadow Valley High."
"Great. Thanks. Ok, am I speaking with Neil Summers?","#Yep, that's me."
"Thanks. #Um, mister Summers, I'm going to ask you some questions and then we'll get an adjuster out to your apartment to look over the damaged property. Sound good?",Yeah. That'll work.
On what date did the damage occur?,"#Um, it was three days ago, so June thirtieth, I think."
"Ok. June thirty. And, in your own words, please describe the damage in as much detail as possible.","Ok. #Um, so there's a bunch of people in my apartment, like near my unit, that starting getting sick. They saw weird looking bubbles on their walls and like water damage, but no water was like coming in anywhere."
#Mhm.,"Then, long story short, the landlords sent in maintenance and they found mold in almost all of the apartments on my floor. The did some tests and found out that my apartment walls were covered with really bad mold, like inside the walls."
#Uh-oh. That's not good.,"Right. So, they told me I would have to move out for a certain amount of time and they are suggesting that any of my furniture that is fabric, I should get rid of because of mold spores."
Ok. Got it. Anything else?,"Well, they also said that I would have to get all my clothes, towels, curtains, you know, anything that's made out of fabric, to go to the dry cleaners. They also told me I should have my health checked out because of the mold spores."
"#Oh, no! That's terrible.",Yeah. I'm a little freaked out.
"I bet you are. I would be. Ok, so anything else?","Well, I had to find a place to stay, so I tried to find a b. and b. I found one, but it's not cheap and wanted to figure this insurance thing out because I'm hoping I can get reimbursed soon."
"I understand. Well, from today, it will be a few days to get the adjuster out to you and for them to process the report and then approximately another five to seven days for the check to get to you.",#Mhm.
"So, that's about two to three weeks at least.",#Hm. Ok. Anything I can do to hurry it along?
"Well, I can open a claim, you can give me an estimate, then after the adjuster submits their report, if there is a difference, you would have to reimburse us, or, if it's in your favor, we would send you an additional check. Make sense?","Yes, well, for now, I just want my lodging to be paid for."
"Great. We can do that, no problem.","Ok, well, so far, I've spent about four hundred dollars on my lodging."
"Ok, and how long did they say you needed to be out of the apartment.","Well, it depends on how soon I can get my furniture out of the apartment. They already put those machines to capture all the mold spores and those are running right now, but they said the furniture needs to out before they can do things like replace the carpet and some of the drywall."
I understand. Is the apartment complex willing to move you to a different apartment?,"They said they would, but they're at full capacity right now."
"#Oh, ok.","It's like they need things done in a certain order to make sure all the spores are out, are captured by the machines."
"I understand. It sounds like a lengthy problem. I'll send out a check to you for at least the cost of your b. and b. for the next two weeks and if you are allowed to get back into your apartment before then, you can apply that amount to whatever the adjuster adds to his report.",Great. Thanks. That will help so much.
Good. I'm glad. Give me one second while I process this and then we'll get your appointment with adjuster made.,Ok.
One moment.,#Mhm.
"Ok, so I'll send a confirmation of all this to the email address in your file.",Ok.
Let me pull up the schedule for the adjuster. One moment.,#Mhm.
"Ok, would this Friday work?",It depends on what time.
Any time between ten a.m. and noon.,Ten a.m. is good.
Great. Let me schedule this. One moment.,Ok. Thanks.
"So, I have this scheduled for you. You'll get another email with the appointment information.",Thanks.
"Before I process this check, let me verify your mailing address.","Sure. It's seven two two one West Elm Drive, unit two twenty seven."
Great. That's what I have on your account. One moment while I process this check.,#Mhm.
"Ok, so I'm sending a check for you for fourteen hundred dollars based on the information you gave me about your lodging costs.",Thanks.
"Ok, mister Summers, your claim is open, your adjuster appointment is scheduled, and there is a check on its way to you.",Thanks.
My pleasure. Is there anything else I can do to help you?,"So, after the adjuster comes by, I just wait?"
Yes.,"So, what do I tell my landlord? Should I hire someone to come get the furniture or take it to the dump?"
"Well, since your adjuster appointment is in a couple of days, I would just wait to see what they find and go from there.",Ok.
"If your landlord needs any information as far as you filing this claim, I'm happy to send a copy of the open claim to them electronically.","Ok. I doubt they'll need it, but I'll call if I need it."
Great. Anything else?,Do I need to give the adjuster anything when they get here?
"No, they'll have all your information. They'll just be taking photos and filling out forms.",#Oh. Right. Sounds good. Do I need to be here the whole time?
"Yes. They won't take long, but in case they have questions, they'll need you there.",Ok. I can do that.
Great. Do you have any more questions for me?,"No, I think that, well actually, how long after the adjuster does his thing before I get a check?"
"After the adjuster submits their report, it will take another five to sevent business days to process the information and check.","Ok, do they submit their report the same day as my appointment?"
"Usually, unless something comes up. Your appointment is in the morning, so they'll probably have plenty of time to upload, submit it before the end of the day.",Oh. Got it. Thanks.
Any more questions?,"No, that's it. Thanks a lot."
My pleasure. Thanks for calling Rivertown. Have a great week.,"Thanks, you, too."
"Thank you, bye.",Bye.
