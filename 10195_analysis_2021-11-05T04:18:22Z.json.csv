Mm-hmm.,The expiration date is twelve of twenty four and what kind of code did you need?
The security code on the back of the card. It should be three digits.,Oh. Yes. It's three two two.
Perfect. So to confirm we will be enrolling you in the Complete Auto plan and making a one time charge in the amount of two thousand dollars effective today.,Yes.
Alright Sandra I've got that processed for you. What's a good email to send a confirmation to?,It's Sandra underscore Saunders at gmail dot com.
