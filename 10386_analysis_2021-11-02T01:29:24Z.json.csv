Was there any other damage to your car besides the windshield?,No.
That's good. Now is the windshield have a rock ding or a crack?,Why?
Well sometimes a ding can be filled without removing the windshield.,Oh. Why would you wanna do that?
Because when you have to replace your windshield it can comprise the structural integrity.,Really?
Yeah. You don't want to replace it unless it's necessary. The new one may not fit as tightly.,Oh. That's something no one has ever explained to me before.
My Dad and my husband both taught me that. Although we use the very best windshield service out there.,Okay. That's good.
And they'll let you know if you really need it replaced or not.,"Okay. That's good, too."
"Well your account has full windshield protection, so we can set up an appointment to have it looked at.",Where do I have to take it?

"Anywhere. Home, your work, even the zoo if that's where you are.",That's fantastic!
We try to make it easy on our clients.,Sweet!
So when would you like to set up your appointment?,Do I need to be there?
No. You can leave your keys on the floor of your car and the technician will lock up and bring you the keys.,Great. So I can see it before he leaves?
"Yes, of course. He'll need your signature before he leaves.",Yes. I have time for that!
So where would you like them to come?,I'm getting ready to have my hair done soon. Could they do it there?
