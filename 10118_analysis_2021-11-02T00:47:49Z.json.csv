Right. Were you able to sort out the issue with your other insurance company?,"Yeah, glad I got to finally terminate my account with them."
I'm sorry you had to experience all of that.,Their premiums were outrageous plus they got shitty coverage.
Be rest assured you will have the best customer experience with Rivertown Insurance.,I hope so because my buddies over here got nothing but good reviews about Rivertown.
That's great.,So about the condo quote. I've not moved in yet but I've acquired the property.
Okay.,So I'm looking for the best policy plan with coverage and benefits to suit my needs.
You're at the right place. We've got two condo policy plans with different levels of coverage for you to choose from.,nice.
"We've got the condo basic which covers expenses caused by theft, fire and smoke, vandalism, sudden and accidental damage to your plumbing, water heater, air conditioning system or house hold appliances.",Sounds good. And the second plan?
Right. The second we've got the condo preferred this covers all the condo basic policy covers andd even more.,Like?
It provides protection for covered liability claims or lawsuits. Let's say a vistior gets hurt in your property. It's covers medical bills for your visitor.,Cool.
"Your personal belongings such as jewelries, paintings.",Mhm nice! How much do they both cost though?
The condo basic goes for an annual rate of five hundred dollars.,That's how much in premiums montly?
Forty dollars.,okay and the condo preferred?
The condo preferred goes for an annual rate of six hundred dollars which is a fifty dollars in montly premiums.,"Great, it's settled then. I'll go for the condo preferred policy plan."
