"Rivertown Insurance, this is Gabe, how can I help you?","Gabe, hi, my name is Sam. I need to, uh, find out how much it costs to get insurance for my dog."
"Sure, I can help you with that.",Great!
I'm just going to ask you a few questions here to make sure we get you the right kind of policy.,"Okay, sounds good."
Did you just get him?,"No, we've had him since he was a puppy. But lately it seems like he keeps needing to go to the vet and it's getting expensive."
"Sure, I understand. Well, let's see if we can get some insurance going for him. Let me start by getting your last name, Sam.","Okay, it's Horton."
"Alright, Horton, h.o.r.t.o.n.",Yes.
"Okay, and what's your address?",two one four eight Kringle Street in Dundee Oregon.
"Alright, that was two one four eight?",yep.
"Alright, and did you say Kringle Street, like Kris Kringle.","Yep, just like Santa Claus."
"Alright, Kringle, k.r.i.n.g.l.e. Got it. And that was in which city?",Dundee.
How do you spell that?,D.u.n.d.e.e.
"Alright, d.u.n.d.e.e. and did you say Oregon?",Yes.
I hear Oregon is beautiful! Lots of mountains and trees!,"Yes, it is. We love it here."
I have always wanted to go out that way and see the Oregon coast.,You should! Just don't get in the water!
Oh really? Why?,It's cold! You'll get hypothermia!
Really? I live in Iowa. We don't get to see the ocean very often.,Wow. I've always lived here so it's hard for me to imagine a life where I couldn't go to the coast for the weekend.
"That sounds amazing. Alright, let's get back on track here. What's your birthdate?",May twenty-six of eighty two.
"Alright, that's May twenty six of nineteen eighty two. What about an emai address for you?","Sure, it's dad of four and gmail dot com."
that's d.a.d.o.f.f.o.u.r at gmail dot com. Four kids?,Yep!
I've got two myself. Kids are fun aren't they?,"Sometimes they are, sure. Sometimes they drive me nuts!"
absolutely! Alright and is the number you called in on a good contact number for you? Ending in nine five seven six?,"Yep, that's my cell. We don't have a home phone."
"Very few people do nowadays. Alright, let's talk about your dog. Do you know his breed?",He's a yellow lab.
"Ah, labs are good dogs!",He's been a great dog.
Do you know how old he is?,"Yeah, it's about seven I think. We're not too sure. We got him as a puppy back in two zero one five but I couldn't tell you the day he was born."
That's okay. We can kind of guess here. Do you remember the month you got him?,I know it was in the fall. Maybe October?
Alright. Do you know about how old he was when you got him.,I think a couple months old. So maybe he was born around August.
"Alright, let's just call it August first, does that work for you?","Sure! Hey, now my dog has a birthday!"
That's right! You can get him one of those birthday cakes for dogs now!,My wife would be all over that! She loves that kind of stuff. She already spoils him rotten!
"Well, they become a part of your family, don't they?","Yes, absolutely!"
"Alright, now let's talk about his health. Does he have anything going on medically right now that you're worried about?","He's actually in great shape. We feed him the best food we can find. Like I said, my wife spoils him. He just seems to get into trouble with the wildlife a lot."
Oh! Do you live out in the country?,"Yeah, we have a lot of raccoons, possumiss skunks, porcupines. Lately it's been the porcupines."
"Oh yeah, those quills are the worst.","Yeah, you'd think he would learn, but he can't help himself."
That can get expensive too. Do you have any other concerns?,"Well, I know that labs are prone to hip problemiss I don't see any signs right now, but I want to be prepared for that. I'm hoping he doesn't get it."
That's true. Labs are prone to hip dysplasia. What about his teeth?,The vet says his teeth need a little work. He wants us to brush his teeth but I'm telling you right now that isn't happening. I've tried. He takes off and won't come near me.
"Well, we have a plan that includes dental cleanings, so that's why I'm asking.","Yeah, that would be great."
Alright. Do you have any other pets that you would want to add to the plan?,"Nope, just him. Unless you cover goats."
"Sorry, we don't do goats. Just dogs and cats.",Well then that's my only pet.
"Alright. Well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like our Petcare Preferred Plan would be your best bet. It will cover all your office visits, you'll get twenty five percent off of any labs and testing. It also includes dental cleanings and check ups.",That sounds perfect. What's that run?
"It's a thousand dollars per year, which we can break down into monthly payments if you prefer.",Alright. That's expensive but I think it will work out to be less expensive in the long run.
It does tend to save people money. Some of those preventative services like check-ups and dental cleanings really help to preserve the dog's health.,"Yeah, and he's worth it. We love him."
Of course! So does this sound like something you'd like to do today?,I need to talk it over with my wife.
No problem. I can send a quote to your email. You can think it over and give us a call back if you decide to do it.,That would be great. Thanks for all of your help today!
No problem. It was great talking with you. Is there anything else I can help you with?,Nope. That's it. Good talking to you too.
"Alright, Sam. Have a great day and we hope to hear from you soon.",Sounds good. Thanks!
You're welcome. Goodbye.,Goodbye.
