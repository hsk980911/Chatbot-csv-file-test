agent,customer
Good morning! This is Timothy Brum back in the office of Rivertown Insurance. How can I help you today?,"Hello Timmy this is Betty, widow of Omar. I am calling today to get my life insured. I have never done this. Omar went to see Jesus and did not come back. He kept him."
"Yes, I know I was there. Knew Omar for twenty-five years. So tell me some more about needing life insurance?",There are expenses Timmy besides the coffin. Which Omar had policy for that and paid for with the funeral policy. I have it here in the Omar's drawer. If I open the drawer I just freeze. Cannot seem to reach for it. I called you.
"Let me just type in your name Betty, and I know the last name is Hunt.","I have all that here in Omar's drawer, but I think it would be better if you gave me a list Timmy."
"I hear you, Betty. Found the policy. You and Omar both have life insurance.",Omar took care of that for me.
"Yes, Omar did. Let me go through what the life insurance policy lets you do Betty.",I appreciate that Timmy.
Omar made you a financial safety net for when he went to see Jesus who kept him.,#Uh I have money to pay extra expenses? I have an insured life.
"Yes ma'am, your life is insured. You can pay off mortage, medical bills, estate settlement or any other unpaid obligation.","Timmy it might sound like a stupid question, but how do I get the money? It has not magically shown up in the bank account. I was hoping to."
Betty you need to get Omar's death certificate. You need to get several of those for your business things.,How do I do that?
"Call up the funeral director they often help with that. If not call back here, and we will set up an appointment to do that.",Oh. Give me a moment. Have to get a Kleenex. You used the d word. I'm back.
"My apologies for using the d word, Betty.",It is okay Timmy I have to get use to it.
The going to meet Jesus and staying certificate comes in about two weeks once requested. It makes accessing the money faster. Otherwise it might be as long as two months.,I have plenty for the month. Mostly I want to get it done.
Understandable Betty. #Um may I tell you more about life insurance policies?,#Mhm.
Were you with Omar when he got the policies?,"As I recall, I came in and signed, but was not in the meeting about the policy when Omar made the decision."
On the policy a spot exists for a beneficiary. I have to check that Betty since that is the person who gets the money.,Go ahead and look.
Doing so Betty. Opening the policy. Betty you are the beneficiary.,After the Omar met Jesus certificate and stayed what happens next?
"If you are in agreement how about you call back letting me know you have the certificate, set up an appointment, and we will take care of it that way as well as that requested list.","Business done, Timmy."
Not quite Betty. Permission for me to view your life insurance policy?,Yes.
"Opening it and looking at it now. Okay Betty, you have Omar as the beneficiary. You might consider changing that.","I was hoping that I would go first, I suppose. What can be done?"
You can leave the money to a loved one. It can have instructions for estate use that you leave with a lawyer or you can give the money to the loved one. A few people add to or make a trust fund.,Can we handle that when I come in for the appointment? Have to think about it.
If you have a lawyer you might consider talking with him or her and the funeral director.,I do have a lawyer.
One more thing if you decide to move to the life insurance pay out to inheritance you need to know how the estate taxes would work. It would affect your heirs.,Do you handle that Timmy? I like to avoid IRS contact. Relatives do things.
I do not handle that Betty. I just sell insurance. Understand about relatives.,If the cops or IRS does not ask the right question my lips are sealed. They have to ask the right question that is the game.
Good policy Betty. Might try that here at Rivertown Insurance. I heard you have a new Persian kitty?,"Omar was ill, and we were stuck in the house so yes Pitty Patter has been a joy. Cutest kitty ever with a sweet mew."
Male or female Betty?,Female. Has such a cuddly personality so want to breed her.
Let me know. I might want one of the kittens. Then I would compete with you at the Cat Show.,Timmy you know I will win. I always do.
"I hear you, Betty.","Are we done, Timmy?"
"For now, Betty. Now don't you forget about our date. I will call and check on you if I do not hear from you.",Oh Timmy. Then I will have a wild tale. .
Okay Betty. Take care.,Bye Timmy.
