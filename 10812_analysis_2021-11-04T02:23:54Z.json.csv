"Good morning, and thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. This is Charlie. How may I assist?",Hello there! I'm just calling-I actually called yesterday.
Oh?,"Yes, and I'm calling again today because after chatting with Richard-."
Mhm.,I've decided to open an account with you.
That's great news! I'd be happy to assist you.,Thank you. We went over all the different accounts and everything-.
Richard gave you all the quote information you needed?,"Yes, yes. And I think we are going to go with the Home Complete package. No auto right now, but the Home Complete."
That sounds great. But Richard did mention that we offer discounts for multiple coverage policies?,"Yes, yes. Richard told me. But my husband wants to wait just yet."
I completely understand. I am happy that you've decided to switch to Rivertown for your home insurance needs.,"Oh, yes! My neighbor Rhonda told us they had a wonderful experience with some flooding that happened. We had the same kind of damage and our insurance company just gave us the run-around like you couldn't believe!"
"I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Yeah, I think being a smaller, local company gives us an edge when you need to get a quick response as far as claims.",I should say so! She was having someone out to repair while we were still waiting for a call back from our agent.
"Shoot, that must have been tough.","Well, it just pays to have friends who can steer you in the right direction, right? ."
"That's for sure. Okay, well, let's get you all set up!",Marvelous.
May I have your full first name please?,My name is Marsha Stirling. That's S-t-i-r-l-i-n-g.
"And just to clarify, you want to be the main name on the account?","Oh, yes. I handle everything with the house ."
"Sounds good! Okay, missus Stirling, what is your birthdate, please?","November third, nineteen fifty-eight."
"Thank you. Next we will need, the best phone number to reach you at?","That'd be my cell phone. We don't even need a landline anymore! John wants to keep it for emergencies, but it's just getting dusty! ."
"I understand. Crazy how outdated landlines are now, right?",That's right. Getting ready for these electric vehicles to just take over. .
"Things change quickly, right?",That's for sure. .
"Okay, missus Stirling. Now I need to gather some information to protect your account.",Okay?
I'll need to gather your social security information and we'll also need to select a security question for your account.,"Oh, okay. So the social security number first?"
"Yes, please.",That'd be five-two-two-six-eight-seventeen-eighty-one.
"Was that, Five-two-two, six-eight, seven-one-eight-one?","Yes, dear. That's it."
"Great, thanks for verifying that info. Cool that you've got it memorized.",Well I've had it for long enough!
You're ahead of me. I always have to take the card out and take a peek.,I'm like that with most things. I guess it's stored in my long-term memory.
"Okay, then. Now we need to select a security question. Would you like, let's see here, the name of the street where you were born?",Where I was born? Where I lived after I was born?
"Yes, I guess they should word it more like, the street you grew up on.","Yes, yes. Let's do that. I don't think anyone else knows but me, and it's a simple thing for me to recall. Long term memory."
Sounds good. What's the name of the street?,That's be Hushpuppy Drive.
Hushpuppy? That's cute! My street is just numbers.,"I hated it in elementary. Everyone would tease me, call me the puppy on Hushpuppy drive."
School bullies are the worst.,"Well, it sounds like it's even tougher for kids now. Can't believe what some folks have to put up with."
"Yes, it's really sad. #Um, well thank you for verifying the question. Now we can get to the information for the home in which you currently reside.","Okay, sounds good. You need the address?"
"Yes, the full address, please.","That's be nineteen nineteen Lodestone Avenue. That's in Kearns, Utah. Eight-four-one-one-eight."
Great. Thanks for that.,"Are we getting close? I'm not trying to rush, I just need to go walking with my neighbor here in a bit."
"Yes, yes. We are getting super close to completion. If for any reason you have to go-.",Oh no! Marjorie can wait. I have a cup of coffee here for her anyhow. And she hasn't even showed up yet.
"Great. But for any reason you need to go, you can always update or change information on our webstie.","Well, I'm not exaclty great on a computer, but that's good to know."
"Okay, so let's get going here.",Wonderful.
So you've decided you wanted to take advantage of our Home Complete coverage? That's our top of the line coverage-.,"Yes, that's the one my neighbor recommended."
And you understand the coverage? That was thoroughly talked about when you called yesterday?,I think I chatted poor Richard's ear off! .
"Oh, now. That's why we're here. There's never too many questions.","You're too sweet, dear."
"Well, thank you, ma'am. So, it looks like that will be a fee of two-thousand annually.",That sounds right.
How would you like to be billed?,"I'd like the bill to be sent to my home, please. Still a sucker for paper billing."
"Sounds good. Let me make a note here. And if anytime you want to utilize our autopay feature, just give us a ring. Or you can use the website to change your billing preferences.","I'd probably just call in, faster and easier for me . Though I know others would probably like the website."
Great. Just wanted to let you know there's always an option to change.,Thank you.
"Also, how would you like to pay? We offer monthly, bi-annually or annually.","I think I'd just like to get it over in one blow, you know?"
So you'd want the annual payment?,"Yes, please."
"Sounds good. You're an easy customer, for sure. Sometimes people want us to set up a bi-monthly payment.",Oh! People are just living paycheck to paycheck. My heart goes out to them.
"Yes, homes are so expensive now. That's for sure.","So, can the coverage being on the first of next month? That's when my old coverage is due to expire."
Yes! That was my next question. So you'd like to begin coverage September first?,"Yes, that would be ideal."
"Okay. We are set, I think. You should be receiving your annual bill for two-thousand dollars in the next week.",Mhm. That sounds great.
"Are there any other questions I can help you with today, missus Stirling?","Not now, but I'm sure I'll be calling back with something ."
"Well, you enjoy your walk and have a wonderful day!","You too, dear. Oh! There's the bell! We have great timing ."
"Well, thanks again for calling Rivertown Insurance. You have a great day.",Marjorie will be happy that I took her advice.
I'm glad to hear that. Good-bye for now.,"Bye, now."
