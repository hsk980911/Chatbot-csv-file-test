"Good day, this is Roberto. Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance.",Hello? I just needed to-to cancel autopay?
"Sure, I can help you.","Oh, good. I can't figure out how to cancel it online."
"No problem. Sorry to hear it isn't, working out?","It's not that it's not working out, I'm-I'm just having a problem with one of my credit cards."
"Yeah, no problem at all. I'd be glad to help you get that set.",My problem is that my wife has access to my credit card and keeps spending too much on it.
"Oh, yeah. That definitely happens.","I like to pay the balance off everything month, which is usually easy, but not when there's a couple of thousand in-I don't know-crafting materials on it."
"Wow! Crafting material, huh? Your wife spends that much on crafting?","Oh, yeah. She's at artist? Like a welder artist?"
"Oh, wow.","Yeah. You she makes animal statues from reclaimed metals? But the welding equipment itself is really expensive. And sometimes the reclaimed metals cost money too. Like, she can't just always get it from the dump?"
"Yeah, sounds like it can be an expensive hobby.",And she eventually sells them. It's just that it's not steady enough that I can pay off those high amounts monthly. And I hate having that balance on the card. Like throwing money out the window.
I completely understand. I can totally help you get rid of autopay.,"Oh, thanks. I appreciate it. What info do you need?"
I'll just need to start with your full name and birthdate please.,My name is Julie DeNiro. Like the actor. And my birthdate is March twentieth nineteen eighty-five.
"Okay, thanks for that information, Julie.",No problem.
"Okay, I'll also need your policy number?","Oh. Yeah, of course. Can I check to see if I have it in my wallet?"
"Sure, no problem.",Thanks. Be back in just a sec.
Yeah.,"So, I don't have it on me? Is there any other way we can look it up?"
"Yes, we can use your social security number and security question to access the account.","Yeah, sure. Let's do that."
Great. What is the social on the account?,"It's five-two-five, six-seven, two-three-three-four."
Thank you.,"Yeah, sure."
"And, let's see here, your-.",My security question thing?
Yes! It looks like your questions is what is your high school mascot?,"Oh, okay. It's a dolphin. We were the dolphins."
The mighty dolphins!,"Yeah, but dolphins really are crazy. They are actually, super aggressive?"
Oh?,"Yeah, I saw this show where they were like flipping seals in the air just to, like, mess with them."
"Seriously? I thought they were like, I don't know-hippies?","No, not at all! They are like bullies of the sea. After of orcas, of course."
Orcas? Like Free Willy?,"Yeah, they are super mean. Just finished reading this book about The Essex-that ship that Moby Dick is based on?"
Uh-huh?,"Yeah, they will attack without provocation. I mean, but The Essex is a whaling ship, so maybe they had provocation because humans our out there killing everything? I dunno."
"Yeah, guess that gets kind of complicated.",Yeah.
"Okay, well, thanks for the security confimation. I'm taking a look at your account now.","Oh, yeah. Guess I kind of just went off there ."
No problem-it was interesting!,I think so.
"Okay, so first, it looks like you have our Renters Preferred insurance?","Yeah, that sounds right."
"And you're on autopay, but you pay just an annual payment, right?",Yeah. Our payment's due on the first of August.
"So, this problem with overdrawing, it isn't every month?","Ah, no. It was just this last month, but it was a huge fight."
"Okay? You sure you want to go to paper billing? I mean, you only have the one bill-.","I just can't afford to get my credit dinged. I'm cancelling all my autopay billing options. Like everything, not just insurance."
"Oh, I see. But there are, other options?",Oh yeah?
We could have the autopay come directly out of a checking account instead of a card?,Oh! So it would come from my bank account?
Yes. With it only being once a year-.,"No, that's actually a really good idea. I'm kind of scattered, so it would help not having to keep track of a bill."
Great. Let's do that then.,Awesome. What will you need? Like a voided out check?
I'll just need your routing number and checking account number.,Cool. Let me go grab the info.
No problem.,"Okay. So, let's see. The routing number first?"
"Yes, please. That'd be great.",And that's the-the first number on the bottom?
You've got it!,"You're so positive, I love it. Okay, ready?"
Shoot.,Six-seven-seven-eight-nine-two-four-three-one.
Thanks for that. And the bank?,It's Chase.
Thank you.,Ready for the account number?
Yep.,"One-five-five-three-four, uh, six-two-three-three-three."
Okay. Going to read that back to you real quick.,Okay.
"One-five-five-three-four, uh, six-two-three-three-three?","Yeah, you've got it right."
"Sweet. Okay. You're all set! Your three-hundred dollar annual payment for Renter's Preferred policy will automatically withdraw from your account the first of August, so, in a year.","Hey, great. And will I get like a receipt?"
"Yes, you'll be notified by your email on file, the, uh, firebird at one two three dot com?",That's right.
"Yeah, you'll receive a notice that funds will be automatically be withdrawn and you'll also receive a receipt. You can also view any information about your account on our website.","Sounds great! Hey, thanks so much for getting that taken care of."
No problem at all! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?,Nope. I'm all out of sea creature facts too .
