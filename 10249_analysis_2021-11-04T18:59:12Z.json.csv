"Oh no, I am sorry about that, so let's try to fix that for you.",That would nice.
First let me get your account information.,Well that won't work will it if you have my wrong address.
I can look it up by other information.,"Okay whatever, I guess you know more about this stuff than me."
What is your name?,Cheryl Lane.
Can you spell that please?,Oh #jeez alright. c.h.e.r.y.l. for Cheryl and l.a.n.e. for Lane.
Thank you miss Lane.,#mhm.
And what.,Actually it's missus Lane.
"Oh I'm sorry, missus Lane. missus Lane what is your account number?",Well I don't remember that.
Okay what is your date of birth?,four twenty seventy.
four twenty seventy?,Yes.
Okay let me check your account.,Alright.
The address listed on your account in nineteen nineteen Waterbrooke Court Hillsboro Iowa seven two nine three six.,No no no that is not correct. I have not lived there for three years. I don't know why you still have that address.
Okay so let me update it for you. What is your current address?,two zero nine Menoken Way Hillsboro Iowa.
And with the same zip code? seven two nine three six?,Yes.
Okay so let me confirm your address with you.,Yes please.
two zero nine Menoken Way Hillsboro Iowa seven two nine three six. Is that correct?,"Yes, that's correct. And I hope to sticks this time."

I hope so too missus Lane but just in case. It could have been a problem with the system before. We did have an update with our system recently because there were some glitches.,Yeah that may have been the case then because it was just weird that my address just wasn't updated.
Yeah that does seem weird.,Because all of my calls have been like this one.
To update your address?,Yes. Where the agent updates it in real time and confirms it with me but I keep not getting letters or notices or they come with change of address on them.
Well hopefully it was just the system then and the update took care of that glitch.,I hope so too.
Is there anything else I can help you with?,"No I think I'm good now, hopefully."

Well we appreciate the kind words. Thank you very much missus Lane. I hope you have a good day.,You as well.
Goodbye.,Bye now.
