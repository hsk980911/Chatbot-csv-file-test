agent,customer
Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?,Yeah. I'm shopping around for life insurance rates and I wanted to see how you guys compare. I heard a lot of good things about your company from friends.
Perfect! I'd be more than happy to provide you with a life insurance quote.,Great.
Let's start with your first and last name.,It's Maria Sanchez.
"Nice to meet you, Maria. What's got you in the market for life insurance?",Well I'm not getting any younger and I don't want to leave my family with a burden.
I can definitely understand that. Smart choice.,I think so.
What state do you live in?,I'm in Colorado.
Perfect. And you are female correct?,Yes.
Do you currently use any type of tobacco products?,"No, never had any desire to."
Great. That will save you some money.,Hopefully so! .
What is your height and weight?,I am five foot seven inches tall and I weigh one hundred and forty pounds.
And do you have any pre-existing conditions?,Nope I'm healthy as a horse so far.
Great to hear! So you would describe your health category as in good health?,Absolutely.
What kind of coverage amount were you looking for?,I was thinking around the five hundred thousand mark.
We can definitely manage that.,Great.
Now we do offer different types of policies. Are you familiar with life insurance?,Not really.
"Okay we have term life, whole life, and universal life that we offer here.",What's the difference?
"Term life is a set amount for a set period of time such as like ten years, twenty years, et cetera.",Okay.
Whole life and universal life are essentially for the remainder of your life and they build cash value.,Mm-hmm.
The difference between those is that in whole life we decide how the cash value is invested and universal life you have more control.,I like the idea of the ones that build cash value.
Great. Those are both good choices. Would you prefer whole life or universal life?,probably whole life because I'm more familiar with it.
Great.,What is the price difference?
The whole life policy we offer will be eighteen hundred per year.,And the universal life?
It's quoted at twelve hundred per year.,okay. Yeah I still think I would prefer a whole life policy.
Great. May I have a phone number or email address to send the quote to?,Yes my phone number is eight five zero seven one two eight five three three.
Great. Would you like it emailed also?,Yes. Email is Maria dot Sanchez at gmail dot com.
Perfect! What do you say we go ahead and get you enrolled?,I do have a few other places I want to get quotes from first. Can I call back in if I decide to move forward?
Absolutely. You can call back in or select the personalized link in the email I sent to finalize the quote.,Great.
Was there anything else I could do for you today?,No. I think that was it.
Great. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Goodbye.,Bye.
