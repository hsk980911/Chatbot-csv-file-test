Ok. I can help with that. Can I get your name?,Marty.
"Thanks. And, last?",Townsend.
Thanks. Can I get your birthdate?,Birthdate's five twelve eighty seven.
"Ok. May twelfth, nineteen eighty seven.",Right.
"#Mhm. Now, I'll verify your account. What's your, the name of your childhood best friend?",That's easy. Don.
That's not what I see here.,#Oh. Sorry. Donald.
That's it. Great. Thanks for verifying.,No problem.
"Ok, so I see here that your condo insurance payment is supposed to come out automatically in a few days. Was there a problem? Did you get an email from us?","No, I just have a different card I want to use this month."
"#Oh. Ok, well we are in the window where I'm not sure the automatic payment can be canceled in time.","#Oh no. I need to, well I'm spread a bit thin this month and I'm worried about the payment going through."
"I understand. Well, let me think. Give me a moment.",Sure. #Mhm.
"Ok. If for some reason what we do today doesn't catch the current payment cycle and the payment doesn't go through, just call us back as soon as possible, and we can run the payment on your other card, just make sure to call us back within the grace period.",Grace period?
"Yes, within a couple days of the due date.","Got it. So, I won't get a late fee?"
No as long as your within the grace period.,Fine. Let's go ahead then?
Sure. Let me get the card number you want to use for this payment.,It's a Visa.
Ok.,"Six four two one, one three five seven, nine seven one three, two two two zero."
"Six four two one, one three five seven, nine seven one three, two two two zero?",Yes. That's correct.
"Thanks. Expiration, please?","Yeah, it's nine of twenty three."
"And, the number on the back?",Six two three.
Six two three. Got it. Can I put you on hold for a moment while I put in some notes about this conversation just in case your automatic payment doesn't go through?,Sure.
"One moment, please.",Take your time.
Thanks. One moment. Marty?,Here.
Ok. I've entered some notes about our conversation in case you need to call back and process the other card.,Thanks.
You'll get an email confirmation with this change. Are you still using m.a.r.t.b.o.a.t. at yahoo?,"No, I changed it recently. It's, are you ready?"
"Yes, go ahead.",It's Marty boats at gmail.
M.a.r.t.y.b.o.a.t.s.?,Yes.
Do you have a boat?,Kind of. I make specialty models for hobbiests.
Fun! Do you make them from scratch?,"Yes, but if they are supposed to be painted, I use store bought paint."
Does that keep you busy?,"More than you'd think. I do international orders, too, so I keep up with all my orders, but I'm not stressed. It's a good balance."
That must be great doing what you love!,Yes. I feel pretty blessed.
"Nice. So, Marty, I'll send this confirmation now and if you have to call back, there are detailed notes in your file, so they know what's going on.",Thanks.
Is there anything else?,No. Thanks.
Great. Thanks for calling Rivertown and have fun with your boats!,Thanks. Have a good day.
Thank you. Good bye.,Bye.
