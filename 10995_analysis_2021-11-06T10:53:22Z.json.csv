"Good afternoon, thanks for call Rivertown Insurance, this is Greta, how can I help?","Hi. #Um, I'm calling to set up an account."
Ok. I can help you with that. Is there a specific plan you are interested in?,"I tried to set up my account online, but was having some difficulty."
"#Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see what I can do for you.",Thanks.
Is there a specific plan you are interested in?,"Well, I just wanted to start looking at the prices for renters and pet insurance."
Right. Gotcha.,You can't do that until you sign up for an account.
Right. That's correct. The pricing will show up as soon as we receive your basic info.,"Ok. Well, it wouldn't take some of my info so I didn't know what else to do except call."
Great. I will definitely be able to take care of this for you.,Good. Thanks.
Let's begin with your name.,Laurel.
"Thanks. And, your last name.",Davidson.
S.o.n.?,Yes. S.o.n.
"Thanks for that. Now, I'll need your address.","#Um, my physical address or mailing?"
Mailing.,"Sure. #Uh, it's seventeen North Broadchurch Bucksville North Carolina."
Just Broadchurch or Broadchurch road or street?,Just Broadchurch.
"Great. Thanks. And, I'll need the zip.","#Oh, right. #Uh, five six two eight one."
"Five six two eight one. Got it. And, a number for you?",Home phone or cell?
"#Um, whichever you answer most frequently.","That's my cell. It's and this is what was happening on the site. I'd add my number in, but it didn't look like it took it."
Ok. Did you add the dashes?,"#Oh, you mean like four one two dash etcetera?"
Yes.,"I think I did, not sure, though. Does it matter?"
Yeah. It's a bit testy if you add dashes. I need to tell our tech team about it.,Ok.
You're not the first person that's had a tough time with it.,"#Oh, good. I'm not too good with technology, so I thought it was me. ."
No worries. I can take care of it for you.,Thanks.
"Now, probably, here, yeah, it took your number with no dashes. Ok. Now, your birthdate?","December sixth, nineteen fourty six."
"Twelve six fourty six. Got it. And, your marital status?",I'm married.
"Ok. And, your spouse's name?",Harold.
Harold. Got it. Do you have any children under the age of eighteen living with you?,"No. They're all grown. #Oh, wait. My grandaughter stays with us during the summer for about three months. Does that count?"
It may. Does she have her own room with her own stuff there?,Yes. We keep a room for her.
"Ok. Well, I think it would only make a difference on the renters policy if your total household goods was to increase because she lived with you.",#Oh. Ok.
"Honestly, I'm not sure for a new account why they would ask that unless it's for our life insurance department. You know, to let them know make suggestions for other products we offer. Make sense?",Yes. But I don't need life insurance.
Right. I understand. It's basically for future offerings and to let you know what we have available.,Ok.
"Great. Now, do you currently hold renters insurance?","Yes, but I was wondering if you could do it cheaper than the company I have."
Ok. Let's see what we can do for you.,I don't want to really get into it right now. I just wanted the account so that I could look into it myself. Later on.
"#Oh, sure. No problem. Let me finish up creating your account. One moment.",Ok. Thanks.
"No problem. Ok. You're all set! Before we hang up, I wanted to let you know that other than renters and pet insurance, we also offer life, as I mentioned, and auto, homeowners, and condo insurance.","#Oh. Ok. You have auto, too?"
"Yes, and we're very competitive.","Well, I'll have to look into that. We may need to add our granddaughter to our vehicle when she turns sixteen which is coming up quick."
"#Oh, sure. The teen driving years! .",Yes. It goes by fast.
"I can imagine. If you're interested, I can, tell you about our auto plans, if you'd like.",Is it a lot of information? I'm a little tired right now.
"I can just give you an overview and then, if you have questions later, just call me back.",Ok. Sounds good. Go ahead.
"Great! We have three tiers Basic, Preferred, and Complete.",#Uh-huh.
"Basic is a thousand a year, Preferred is fifteen hundred a year, and complete is two thousand a year.",#Mhm.
"Basic starts at a hundred and fifty thousand dollars of coverage for uninsured, underinsured, and medical.",Ok.
Preferred goes up fifty thousand for each of those coverages.,"#Uh, you mean up to two hundred thousand?"
Yes.,Ok.
"And, Complete increases to two hundred fifty thousand.","#Oh, well that's easy to understand. Usually, it's a lot more difficult to understand."
Yes. It can get confusing. We try to keep it simple.,Good. Ok. Thanks.
"Now, you said you wanted to review some things on our site, but are you interested in signing up for auto today?",Not today. I'll think about it all and get back to you.
"Great. Sounds perfect. Anything else I can help you with today, missus Davidson?",No. Thank you. #Uh what are your hours if I call back.
"We're here Monday through Friday, nine to six, central time.","Ok. Thank you. You have a good day, now."
"You, too. Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. Have a good day! Bye!","Thanks, you, too. Bye."
