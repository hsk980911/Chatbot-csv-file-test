"Hello, thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance, how may I assist you today?","Hi there my name is Michael Stockton, and I have an account with you guys, and I was just trying to check how much was left on my bill, but it seems like your system is down."
Right.,So I was just calling to see about that.
"Right, yes. Well, I'm sorry to hear you were having trouble with our web portal.",mhm.
But I can definitely help you check on your account today. Let me see here.,Alright.
I just need to get a few pieces of information from you to verify your identity is that okay?,Yes that's good.
"Okay, and that's-the-the first question is what is your full name and email address?","My full name is Michael Jack Stockton, and my email address is bearsgrilling at hotmail dot com."
Could you spell that email address for me?,B. E. A. R. S. G. R. I. L. L. I. N. G. at hotmail dot com.
Got it. And what is your eight digit customer id number?,My number is I have it right here.
It should be on any piece of correspondence we've sent you in the past.,"Yeah yeah, I have it here. It's one nine two nine seven seven three one."
Seven seven three one you said?,"yep, seven seven three one."
"Alright let me just put that into the system here, and yes, I'm looking at your account now.",Okay.
And you said you wanted to check the outstanding balance on your account?,yes that is correct. I wanted to yes.
"Alright, well it looks like you have an outsanding balance of one thousand three hundred-.",Oh hold on a sec.
Oh.,Yeah sorry let me just get a pen.
Of course.,"Okay ready, can you repeat that number again?"
"Yes, it's one thousand three hundred and sixty seven.",One thousand.
mhm.,Three hundred?
"Yes sir, three hundred and sixty seven.",Why is it three hundred?
Well.,"I mean instead of two hundred, because I thought that-."
,I had- I thought that I had about twelve hundred left on my bill? A little bit more than twelve hundred.
Well let me see here.,But on the bill you just sent me in the mail I still have over thirteen hundred.
Right yes.,That same number you just said.
"Right yes, let me look through the notes on your account to see if I can figure out the answer for you okay?",Okay yeah because I was just confused by that part.
Right we always want to not be confusing.,"mhm, yeah."
And I'm just looking over everything in you account now. so ,Yes?
"Your outstanding balance is calculated by adding up the insurance coverage you chose, the payment plan you chose, and any discounts you may qualify for.",Okay.
"And so you chose our Complete Auto insurance package, and the quarterly payment plan.",Yep.
And you also qualified for our safe driver discount which took off an additional five percent from your total.,Right.
"And, it looks like you don't qualify under that discount anymore, which would explain the- discrepancy in the billing that you are noticing.","Oh, I didn't realize why exacty do I not qualify for the discount anymore?"
"Well, let me read the notes here first.",Because I haven't had any accidents or anything like that.
Yes sir. It just says here that we never received reports from the drive smart devices that we sent you when you first signed up with us.,Oh.
"So that's why the discount was rescinded, it's not that you had an accident, it's just that we didn't get any reports from our devices.","The drive smart devices, you said you sent them to us?"
"Yes sir, we should have sent them to you alongside your original paperwork when you first signed up.","Well I definitely have that, I'm looking at it right now."
And it looks like it was sent out and it says delivery confirmed on my end.,The thing is I don't ever remember seeing those- those devices anywhere and I'm pretty sure I never got them put in the cars.
"Okay, well if you do find them you can always install them into your car and we can make the discount retroactive.",Oh okay.
"We can also mail you a new copy, but in order to do that I would have to mark the previous two as being missing, and the devices have a forty dollar fee for non-return, so.","Oh okay okay, I see. So I really want to find the original ones before I try to do that?"
yes I suppose that is the best option.,"Okay I see yeah, yeah it's a mess here, it could have just gotten lost in the piles."
Oh yeah.,The piles of junk that have accumulated over the years.
Yeah I know how it is.,And it could have gotten lost in any of those so- yeah I guess thank you for helping me solve that.
"Yes of course, is there anything else I can help you with today?",No I don't think so yeah that should be good.
Okay. If you have any more questions or if you need to have a new set of smart devices sent to you don't hesitate to call.,"Yeah, of course."
And other than that I hope you have a great day.,"You too, thank you very much!"
