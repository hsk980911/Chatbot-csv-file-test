"Rivertown Insurance this is Martin, how can I help you?",Yes hi hello I'm interested in homeowner's insurance.
Okay sure. Do you know what plan you want.,not really. I just bought a house and need insurance. My friend recommend you guys.
Oh great we love getting recommendations.,I'm sure you do .
And congrats on buying a home.,Thank you!
Are you a first time home buyer?,Yes that's correct.
Okay so I can tell you about our plans if you'd like.,Sure that would be a good place to start.
Alright so we have three plans.,Only three?
Yes three plans.,Alright not much choice there.
It's pretty standard actually.,Oh really?
#mhm yeah it's pretty standard for most insurance companies. Some have less and some have more but most have three.,Oh okay well then what are these plans?
"So we have the basic plan, preferred plan and complete plan.",m okay.
And the coverage is different for all three.,Okay.
So with the basic coverage you get routine maintenance and minor damage coverage.,Alright.
With the preferred plan you get other things with maintenance covered.,Well I should hope so .
like more complex repairs or if your roof needs replacing more than once every several years.,"And that one, the preferred plan you said?"
The preferred plan yes.,That one comes with more damage coverage?
Yes sir.,Like what?
"Like storm damage, tree damage et cetera.",Oh so that stuff doesn't come with the first plan?
It doens't cover all of it and it has a higher deductible as well.,Oh okay.
That plan is more for people that just need some kind of insurance and feel like they don't live in a damage prone area and are okay with routine maintenance.,#wow okay well I'd definitely like more coverage than that.
"Well our last plan, the complete plan is our most comprehensive plan and that covers everything we offer for home insurance like all types of maintenance, all types of damage even damage you do to the house yourself.",Well now I'm not planning on damaging my home .
No sir I didn't think you were. It's more for accidental damage done by the homeowner but some who choose this plan have teens or younger kids at home that they're afraid will do some damage.,okay yeah that makes sense. And you said it covers more natural damages?
Yes sir.,Like tornadoes? Does it cover tornadoes?
Yes sir the complete plan and the preferred plan cover natural damages like tornadoes but the complete plan covers more and has a lower deductible.,Cause I live in Oklahoma so we definitely get our fair share of tornadoes so I definitely need some good insurance.
Oh okay gotcha. So let me ask you then. Do you live in an area that's prone to flooding?,yeah I think it's a possibility if it gets real bad like if it rains a lot.
Because the complete plan offers flood insurance but the preferred plan does not.,Oh okay well that makes a difference then. I mean I don't know if my area will flood but I don't want to take any chances and then wish I'd gotten the better insurance.
Oh definitely I agree.,Alright so let's talk about price then.
"Right so the basic plan is twelve hundred, the preferred plan is sixteen hundred and the complete plan is two thousand and I'm sorry that's for the year.",Yeah I figured. That would have to be some damn good insurance for those prices to be per month .
Yes sir they would be .,Okay well I've pretty much decided that I don't want the basic plan so that's out of the running. So now just to decided whether to get the complete or preferred.
I can send you more details about each plan through email if you'd like.,Oh no that's okay I think I've got the details I need to make a decision.
Alright.,I'm just trying to decide whether I want flood insurance or not.
"Well you can always add flood insurance onto the preferred plan later on if you want, however it may be more expensive. Or you can upgrade from preferred to complete.",Can I downgrade as well?
Like from complete to preferred?,Yeah exactly.
"Oh yeah for sure, you can change your plan at any time.",What if I have already paid for the year though?
We would prorate your plan depending on how long you have had your other plan.,How would that work?
Say that you paid your insurance upfront at the beginning of the policy and you decide six months in that you want to upgrade or downgrade your policy so then we would credit you half of your payment towards your new policy.,Oh okay I got it. That's cool then. Definitely makes me feel less nervous about choosing a policy.
Good that's what we like to hear.,Alright so since we're getting into tornado and flooding season let me go ahead and get the complete plan then today and I'll pay all costs upfront.
Alright great so just to make sure you want to sign up for a home complete insurance policy and pay the two thousand dollars upfront today?,"Yes, that is correct."
"Alright great so I'll need your name, address and phone to get started.","Alright the name's James Rover r.o.v.e.r., the address is two one four Weeping Pine Lane Underhill Oklahoma seven four six nine two and the phone number is four seven three eight two nine nine zero two three."
Alright thank you mister Rover.,Do you need my social security or anything?
"No sir, we try to not ask for that over the phone anymore.",So how do you know it's me?
Are you the homeowner?,Yes.
And have you purchased the home already?,Yes.
Then we can get the information from the address and phone number.,Oh right.
Okay so how did you want to pay today?,I'll pay by credit card.
"Okay so I'll need the card number, expiration date and CVV number.","Okay so the card number is three zero six six seven nine zero zero nine eight two six one, the expiration date is eleven twenty two and the CVV number is four six three two."
"Alright and just to confirm before I send this through you want to pay the whole policy upfront which will be two thousand dollars, correct?","Yes, that is correct."
Alright so you should be taken care of now and you will receive a packet in the mail with all the information about your plan.,Alright great thanks.
Sure no problem. Is there anything else I can do for your?,Nope that's all thank you. Have a great day.
Thank you and you as well. Goodbye now.,Goodbye.
