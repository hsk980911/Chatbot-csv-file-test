Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!,"Yeah, I wouldn't have even noticed but my trunk won't open. Looks like, I don't know, they were trying to pull in and just went too far?"
I'm sorry to hear that.,"Like, who wouldn't wait and tell the person if it was-oh, hold on. There's someone here-hold on."
"Oh, okay. Yeah, I can hold.","Okay. Okay. Looks like an employee saw the whole thing. Said it was a gold Buick and an old guy. They're going to try to look to see if there's any video footage on the, video cameras."
At least you have a witness!,"Yeah, but now I feel bad that it's an old guy. I mean, my grandpa has like beginning Alzheimer's? And I can see him doing something like this, I dunno."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.",Yeah.
"Well, hopefully he has insurance and, you know, just pays the deductible and your car is taken care of.","Yeah. Yeah, that's not so bad, right?"
"So, I will need to get a couple of peices of information from you?","Oh, sure, yeah."
"What time do you think the accident occurred? Like, ballpark?","Well, it's six thirty right now? So I'm guessing like a half hour ago? Sixish?"
"Okay, we'll put down six o'clock pm. And today is Tuesday, July twentieth, two thousand twenty-one. Sorry, just talking out loud.","Oh, yeah, no problem. I am just a wreck, so, it's soothing to hear you talk, you know?"

"And, what do you, right now, determine the damage to entail?","Well, it looks like the trunk won't open."

Sure.,"Yeah, the trunk won't open and the tail light is busted out."
On what side?,"#Um, left."
Paint damage?,"Oh, yeah. It's all like, bent in and you it's going to need to be, painted or something."
"Okay, so the body was hurt, not just the bumper?","Yes, it smashed the bumper but scratched up the paint too."
How are the tires?,"I mean, they look good. I haven't tried to drive yet or anything."
Okay. And we can always update the details as you find more things wrong.,"Oh, that's good."
"Since this is a fender-bender, we can actually make the claim if you are able to take some pictures and submit online?","#Uh, yeah. I can definitely do that. Do I need to do this while I'm talking right now? I think that girl is going to come back and I might have to go look at the video. See if we can see a license plate number or something."
"I understand. Yeah, you can definitely upload the pictures online after we hang up.","Oh, okay. Great."
Have you used our website before?,"#Um, lemme think. No, I don't think I have."

Oh! So your birthday is tomorrow?,"Yeah, how's that for a birthday present?"
"Well, hopefully we get everything, fixed quickly for you. I'm sure we will.","Hey, thanks."
"You are very welcome. So, the next thing that will happen is that you'll be contacted within the next twenty-four hours by an agent in order to process the claim further.",And what if I'm able to get the license of the guy who hit me?
"I guess you'll just, report that to the police?",You guys don't have a system to search plate numbers or anything?
"Unfortunately, no. And it would be ideal if you could track down the guy so, he can be the one who has to do most of the insurance hassle.",I didn't think you'd admit insurance is a hassle!
