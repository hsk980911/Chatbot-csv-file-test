Good morning. Rivertown Insurance. This is Jessica. How can I help you today?,"Hi, Jessica. I have a policy with you. #Uh, an auto policy, and I just got a new car. I mean, a used car, but new- new to me."
Congratulations! Can I get your policy number?,"Yeah, it's four five eight."
Four five eight.,Q as in q-tip.
Q.,nine seven three two.
nine seven three two.,"A as in apple, C as in car, and then the number three."
"A, C, three. Great, thanks! And can I just confirm your full name and your date of birth?","Yeah, Samuel Boardman. That's B as in, board. O. a. r. d. m. a. n. And birth date is, today, actually."
Happy birthday!,"Thanks! Yeah, today, August second, nineteen seventy two."
"Got it, thanks! Was the car a birthday present?","#Uh, oh, no, no! It was just, time for an upgrade."
I get it! So.,"It's a, twenty eighteen Subaru Outback."
"Oh, nice! Good for toting gear.","Yeah, my stuff, my camping stuff didn't really fit before and I just kept getting more."
So this is replacing your Mazda two.,"Yeah, yeah. Good little car, but I have too much stuff! ."
"OK, so the Mazda was a ",Twenty eleven.
"Great, thanks! OK, I've just got a few questions and then I'll be able to update your policy.",Thanks! And can I do the registration- the updated registration with you? Can I 
"Oh, you'll have to do that through the department of motor vehicles. Sorry! That's the one thing that I can't do from my end.",No worries! Just hoping to skip the d. m. v. lines! .
"Understood completely! But it's, you can do it online and then it should only take like three or four days and then they just mail you your new card- your new registration card.",Sweet! That'll save some time.
Definitely!,And frustration! .
"That, too! So your Outback- it looks like the twenty eighteen model has dual airbags.","Yep. Yeah, it does."
Excellent! That does help lower your premium.,And it's got blind spot monitoring to help reverse and park.
"Unfortunately, that one doesn't help the premium.",Really? Why not?
"It, in case of an accident, it can actually cost more to repair because of all of the sensors.","Oh, man! #Uh, sorry, I guess I get it. Yeah, I'm- I'm not mad or anything."
"No worries! I know, we want the latest technology, and it does help, but with this particular one it can actually increase costs.",An unintended consequence.
"Exactly! And since this is a newer model and a well, a newer car and a different model, I should say.","Yeah, a higher rate."
"For more coverage. Yeah, the rate will increase.","OK, yeah, I- I know."
And will you still be driving it daily?,"Oh, yeah. I mean, to work and stuff and then also on weekends."
On adventures!,Totally! We'll go places the Mazda couldn't go!
"OK, so that part, that aspect isn't changing.","No, no. It'll- it's still gonna be for daily driving."
"OK, OK.","And, I was wondering about "
Yes?,"Could you tell me about your, like, speed tracking? Like how it works and stuff?"
Our Fast App?,"Yeah, yeah."
"Absolutely! It's a app that you download. And what it does is, all you have to do is have your phone in the car with you. Not touching it, of course!",Of course! .
"So like secure in a holder or backpack or wherever. It just has to be in the vehicle. It senses your location, like what road you're on, gets information on the speed limit for that particular road, and then monitors your speed.","OK, OK. So if I don't speed, then "
"So as long as you're within the legal speed limit, oh, and I should add that the phone does sense, or know when there is, like, road construction or something and there's a reduced speed. But as long as you're within the limit, you get a reduced premium.","OK, And if I speed? Do I get, like, penalized or something? Like, do my rates go up?"
"If you speed, then you lose the discount for six months.",OK. And does it affect let's say I get a ticket.
It can't help with that.,"So I'd still, like, get a ticket."
"Yes. So any moving violations you'd still be responsible for, in terms of the payment and the points on your driving record.",And then also the premium increase.
"Yes, you'd have that, too.","OK. So, I do think I want to add that to my coverage. I mean, my policy."
"Excellent! Let me just get that in here. OK, so your current policy is three hundred and nineteen dollars. That's based on six months, paying upfront for six months.","Yeah, I'd still like to do that."
"So the new policy, with the extra coverage- still keeping the comprehensive and collision.","Yeah, yeah, still the same types of coverage."
"So the same coverage on a Subaru Outback, twenty eighteen, with the Fast App.",And the airbags.
"Yep, that's included! So the six-month premium would be four hundred twenty eight.","And if I lose the speeding, or not speeding discount?"
Then it would increase to four hundred ninety two. And then after six months it'd return to four twenty eight if you keep the app.,"OK. So when does it go into effect? Can I start it, like, today?"
I can start the policy immediately if you'd like.,"Yeah, could you? That'd be great!"
"And I'll get the new policy emailed to you. You'll need to have a copy of it, or basically proof of insurance to finish the registration.","OK, yeah. Thanks! I'll sort that out online."
It really is pretty simple! Suprisingly straightforward.,Whoa! .
"Yeah, really! So I can post the policy to your online portal and also email it to you directly.","Great, thanks! #Uh email is S dot Boardman at gmail dot com."
Thanks! I'll get this sent to you right away. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?,"#Uh, no. No, thanks. Thanks for your help!"
You're welcome! You have a great day now.,"Thanks, you too!"
