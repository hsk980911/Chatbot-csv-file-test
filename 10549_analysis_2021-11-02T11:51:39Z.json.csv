"Hello, thanks for calling Rivertown insurance customer service. How may I help you?","Hi, I would like to get the policy number of my current plan.

"Okay, would you like to change your password immediately or call back?","Actually, I was hoping you could tell me the reason why I didn't receive the reset link on my mail."
Alright sir. May I know how when last you tried resetting your password?,"Well, that should be about a week ago."
Okay. Kindly provide your email address please?,My email address is paul kitten at gmail dot com or maybe the one on the file is paul kitten at hotmail dot com. I'm not really sure.
