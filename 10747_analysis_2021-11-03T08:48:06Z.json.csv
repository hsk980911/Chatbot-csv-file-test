agent,customer
Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?,Yes my name is Carol Brown and I've been a customer with you guys for about six years but I'm afraid someone has my information so I need to change my security question.
Hi Carol. I can definitely understand wanting to keep your account secure. I can definitely help.,Great.
Do you know your customer ID?,Let me see if I can find it.
No problem. Take your time.,Is it on my bill somewhere?
Yes it should be in the upper left hand corner.,Oh I see it. It's one two three four five six seven eight.
Great. Thank you. For security purposes can you tell me your date of birth?,Yes it's January ninth nineteen seventy four.
Thank you for that. To begin with can you verify your current security question?,It should be my mother's maiden name.
That's correct. And what is the answer?,Green.
Perfect. What would you like the new security question to be?,How about my favorite pet's name?
That would work.,Okay.
What would you like the answer to be?,Let's put Fluffy as the answer.
Okay so to confirm we have changed your security question to favorite pet's name with a new answer of Fluffy.,Yes that's right.
Okay great. Was there anything else I could answer for you today?,Yes is there another way to change these other than calling in?
Yes there is. You can always change them in your profile settings online.,Where is that at?
Are you currently logged in to your online account?,No but hang on and I can get logged in.
Okay.,Okay I'm there.
Great. In the upper right hand corner you should see a dropdown menu.,Yes.
Once you hover over that profile settings should be in about the middle of the menu.,Oh. I see it! That makes sense.
Yes ma'am. What else can I answer for you today?,Well while I have you can you tell me when my bill is due?
Of course! What policy would you like the bill information on?,I think my auto policy is next.
Yes ma'am. It looks like your auto policy bill is due on July thirtieth in the amount of two hundred thirty dollars.,Okay great.
Would you like to go ahead and make the payment?,"No, not at this moment."
Okay. Was there anything else I could do for you?,No. I think that's all for today.
