"Good afternoon, and thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?","Finally got someone jeez. Yeah. My name is John Brown, policy number one two three four five six seven eight and I need to cancel my plan."
"Hello mister Brown, thank you for that info, I'm sorry to hear you want to cancel but I'm happy to help with that.",Uh-huh sure you're sorry to hear it. You guys have been price gauging me for too long.
I'm sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction with our prices. I'm happy to discuss that with you but I need to verify some information first.,Okay. What do you want?
Can you verify your date of birth for me and your policy number one more time for me? I didn't catch it the first time.,It's one two three four five six seven eight and my date of birth is one one fifty six.
Okay I've got that pulled up here for us. It looks like you're on our Home Complete plan. Is that correct?,Yeah but not for long.
I'm sorry you think our prices are too high. We tend to be competitive in the market. Have you thought about swapping over to our Home Preferred plan instead?,What's the difference? It's probably still to high.
"Well, the Home Preferred plan is a similar level of coverage but your premium will be sixteen hundred per year instead of the two thousand you're currently paying.",Sixteen hundred on the Home Select plan?
"Yes, the Home Preferred plan.",I don't think so. It's really still too expensive for me.
"I understand sir. Again, I'm sorry that you're leaving but we can move forward with your cancellation.",Okay.
"It looks like you've paid your premium for this month, in that case your cancellation will be in effect at the beginning of your next billing cycle.",What day is that?
That would be the fifteenth of August.,That's fine. I don't get a partial refund or anything for what I've already paid?
"No sir, but you will still be covered if anything happens until August fifteenth.",Fine. What else do I need to do to get this thing closed?
That should be all the information I need. I will need to confirm a few details before your cancellation is complete. Is that okay?,I guess so.
"To confirm, we are cancelling your Home Complete plan and that will go into effect on August fifteenth. Do you understand the terms?",Yes I do. Is there any other way to do this? I need to get back to work and this is taking too long.
We are almost finished.,Great.
I have cancelled that plan for you. Did you have any additional questions for me today?,Yeah will I get anything in the mail or in writing so I know this has been cancelled?
Yes. You should be receiving a cancellation notice within seven to ten business days.,Is there any way to expedite that? I need proof that this is cancelled. I don't want you guys charging my account anymore.
"Unfortunately, there is no way to expedite the cancellation notice. I can assure you that the plan is cancelled and you should not have any additional premiums taken from your account.","I guess that's fine, but if anything else comes out of my bank account I will definitely be calling back. You people have taken enough of my money."
I understand. That should not be the case.,Okay great.
Was there anything else we could do for you today?,No. I think that's it.
We thank you for calling Rivetown Insurance. There should be a brief survey at the end of the call. Please rate your service today between one and five.,Is one the lowest?
Yes. One would be the lowest and five would be the highest.,I understand. I will fill it out for you.
Perfect. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.,I won't. I'll be at work .
I know the feeling.,Thanks for your help.
No worries. Goodbye.,Bye.
