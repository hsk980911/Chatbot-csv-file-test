Hello! This Timothy Brum of Rivertown Insurance Agency. How may I help you today?,Hi Timothy! This is Geraldine from church. I doing some considerations. I need your help in deciding some things to add to my house.
#Uh Okay Geraldine. What have you been thinking about in detail?,I have been praying about those thieves in town and about those tornadoes that have been passing through. I got a nudge.
A nudge?,"Oh, you did not hear the sermon two weeks ago. You pray and most of the time Jesus responds, and you ignore it--."
"#Uh where does the nudge come in, Geraldine?","Timothy, I was getting to that. You must be patient. Remember the song I taught you as a teenager in Sunday School. Have patience, have patience don't be in such a hurry..."
"Oh, I remember miss Geraldine. I have never forgotten your lessons. I would not be the good insurance agent today if I had not practiced with you first.",I am glad I did you some good. Now my considerations have been about buying a tornado shelter and putting thief prevention in or buying a safe room. Robert is older now and though still the man needs a little more protection to keep him out of trouble.
How so Geraldine about Robert?,He was in the Korean War and though the memory is strong the body is more frail. Rather than a tussle with a thief thought I would take him to a room. Running away from tornado well Timothy we do not run fast.We sashay. I need a room.
"Now I understand more than I did, Geraldine. How is it you want me to help? The church way or the insurance way?",In my considerations tornado shelters are underground sometimes with a hatch and sometimes with door. Do I get a discount on my homeowner's insurance if I let construction people dig up my flowers to put that in?
#Uh. We do not cover tornado shelters. It's underground and no tornado has ever sucked one up out of the ground yet.,"Well, good that helps. Really, really, really helps."
"Why so, Geraldine?",I was not looking forward to having Robert climb down a ladder into a hole. I was going to buy an inflatable and if he well if that tornado was coming fast I would have dropped him in the hole. Don't tell anyone. It would have been for his own good. It's hell getting old.
Is it okay I speak now Geraldine?,"Why yes, Timothy. I confessed to you, and I feel better that you know about unusual solutions."
Safe rooms are a different story Geraldine. It sounds like the better option for Robert. You can put that that candy--you will not let him have in the safe room. Those cigars you took away. It might help the sashay.,I believe so. I have been pricing safe rooms or looking at converting a room in the house to that. How does insurance work with that?
"Well, Geraldine if it is an addition to your home or you have construction convert a room to a safe room then homeowner's insurance will cover that, and there are some discounts which we will talk more about when you make your decisions.",What about those self-contained safe rooms made to just put outside your home?
"That I will have to do some research and talk with the the home office, Geraldine. I will get that information for you. Was there an incident on your street near the home with thieves?","Not yet. I like to prepare before an incident, Timothy. I did talk with John at church who is a retired law enforcement man. Some things have changed in town. I got to considering what I would do."
What all did the considering involve Geraldine?,"Robert is slower, Timothy. Like winding down a bit every day. Nothing wrong. Still healthy. But eating takes an hour, walking takes longer. We have moved to turtle phase so to complete it he needs a shell."
"Well, Geraldine I don't know what to say to the turrle comparision. We don't insure that either.",I know. You have to adapt and be flexible or your chance of being hurt or injured goes up in old age. I know what adapt or die means now.
"I hear you Geraldine. We have an affiliated partner for medical. I could introduce to them. They do not go to our church, but are good people. We do not do medical directly, but when someone has a car accident it is who we go to make decisions and get advice.",We have medical insurance Timothy several policies all up to date.
"I hope so, but do you have longterm care insurance? Robert is healthy so will possibly last a long time.","Oh, Timothy I understand now. A safe room with assistance like for twenty four hours."
Something like that Geraldine.,Right now I need assistance for emergencies only. Robert never wants to give up his favorite chair.
Understood Geraldine. If you can find a duplicate favorite chair might be good to put in the safe room.,"I had not considered that Timothy, but putting that idea on my list right now. I have to make lists now."
While you have that list out would you like the number for Insurance girl Becky who does longterm care policies?,"No where on my insurance list is longterm care. Yes give it to me, Timothy."
One eight hundred four five four three three eight nine. Tell them Timothy Brum sent you. I will make a call and tell them your situation so you are introduced. Ask for Becky.,Let me repeat it back to you Timothy. One eight hundred five five four three three eight nine. Is that it?
Not quite. One eight hundred four five four--.,Oh let me correct that. Okay Timothy repeat it again.
One eight hundred four five four three three eight nine.,Right back at you. One eight hundred four five four three three eight nine.
"There you go, Geraldine.",Call miss Becky for longterm care insurance.
Correct Geraldine.,"You are a good man, Timothy. Glad you listened to me in Sunday School."
"I am glad I did too, Geraldine. Anything else I can help you with?","Yes, Timothy so how do I insure my safe room."
"I am going to mail you some papers from the government FEMA who did some work on safe roomiss have some discounts, and estimations. You get your estimations. Make your decision. Call me. If I do not hear from you in a couple of weeks. I will call and see where we are at that way. Now miss Geraldine that is between you and I and not every one at church.","I agree with Timothy. I love them, but they put their nose in everything."
One of your lessons Geraldine was--Be wise as a serpent and gentle as doves especially around wolves.,"You did hear me, Timothy. That was a bad day."
"Thought I would let you know, Geraldine.",Thanks Timothy. I think my considerations with insurance are done.
Okay then. Bye Geraldine you have a good day.,Bye Timothy I will.
