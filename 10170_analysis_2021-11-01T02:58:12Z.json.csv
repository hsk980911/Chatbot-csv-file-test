agent,customer
Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?,Yeah I need to go ahead and set up my plan to be cancelled. I've found a better company to cover me.
I'm sorry to hear that you're leaving us but I can process that cancellation for you.,Great.
What is your first and last name?,It's Rhonda Brown.
"Thank you Rhonda, do you know your customer ID?",No.
That's okay I can look you up a different way.,Fine.
What is your social and date of birth?,It's four two four three seven eight nine two two.
Mm-hmm.,Date of birth is oh one one two one nine seven two.
Thank you for that. Can you tell me the phone number associated with the account?,You are asking too many questions why is it so hard to just get help from you guys.
I apologize ma'am. It's just so we can get your information pulled up in the system since you didn't have your customer ID.,Fine. What did you need again?
The phone number on the account.,Two five one three six three four two three two.
And the last question is for you to verify your mother's maiden name for security purposes.,Jones.
Great. Do you mind if I ask why you're wanting to cancel today?,You guys are too expensive and you ask too many questions.
I'm sorry to hear you think we're too expensive. Have you thought about changing your plan so it would be a lower premium?,Why would I do that. I found a company that gives me better coverage for a cheaper price.
I understand ma'am.,Great so just do your job and cancel the plan.
I apologize for the inconvenience.,Fine.
When would you like the cancellation to be effective?,My new policy starts on the first so that's when this one needs to be gone.
Okay so to confirm we are marking the account for cancellation on the first of August.,Right.
Is your email still rhonda underscore brown at gmail dot com?,Yes.
Okay I will send a confirmation to that email that the account has been marked for closure.,Great. Will I get any kind of refund? I've already paid my premium this month.
No ma'am. Because you are covered until the end of the month there wouldn't be any prorated refund.,You guys are just criminals all you care about is money. I'm so glad to be getting away from you.
I'm sorry your feel that way ma'am. That's not how we want to be perceived. If you wanted to mark it for cancellation earlier you would receive a prorated refund.,And then what? Just go without coverage. No thank you.
Okay.,Is it done?
Yes I have sent a confirmation email to the address you have on file with us.,Well you hang on and let me make sure I got it just so I know you didn't screw anything up.
Okay ma'am.,I got it.
Was there anything else I could do for you?,No.
Have a great day.,Whatever.
Goodbye.,Bye.
