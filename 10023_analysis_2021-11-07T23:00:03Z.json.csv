agent,customer
Good morning. Rivertown Insurance. This is Jane. How may I direct your call?,Hi Jane. I need to get a quote for a new homeowners policy. Can you do that over the phone?
I can put you through to one of our homeowner specialists and you can get things started. May I have your name?,"Oh, sure. My name is Ann Wilson. Thanks."
Hi Ann. Do you have any current policies with Rivertown Insurance?,"yeah. I have my current homeowner policy and my auto policy with you guys. I've bought a new house so I need to get a policy on that property. Oh, and I guess I'll need to cancel the one on my house that I sold."
"Okay, great. Congratulations. I'll transfer you to Sandra Miller. She can help you do all of that. Just hold a moment please and I'll put you through to Sandra.","Thanks, no problem. Have a good day."
Hi Ann. My name is Sandra. I understand you're looking for a new homeowners policy?,"Yes, I just bought a new house and I need to get it insured."
Okay. Wonderful. Congratulations. I see your current policy here. Are you still living at that address?,"Yes, I don't take possession of the new property until June fifteenth. I need to keep that policy in place though until that property sells."
"Right, definitely. I hope it sells fast. It's a hot market right now, so it should go quick.",Here's hoping! Although I don't mind having the extra time to move.
So let's get some basic details about the new property. You said you take possession on June fifteenth?,Yes
And what is the address of the new property?,eight eight two nine Warner Street.
Is that here in Summerville?,Yes
And what is the new zipcode?,six one seven three nine four
Great. Okay. I'll ask you a few questions about the property.,Fire away.
We'll start with the age of the property. Do you know when it was built?,nineteen seventy four.
And the size. Do you have the square footage?,"yes, thirteen hundred square feet, with a full basement as well."
Okay. Good. I assume it's on city water and sewer?,Yes! I've had septic before. Never again!
"[Laughs] Okay, that's good. I see you're right near a fire hydrant? Do you recall seeing one?","Yes! It couldn't be closer, right at the front corner of the property. Too bad I can't paint it a prettier color, but at least they won't have to go far should the need arise."
"Exactly. And yeah, not always the most asthetically pleasing things, but its good for insurance purposes.",That's good. At least it has a benefit of some kind.
Are there any other buildings on the property?,"Yes, a double garage."
Does it have power and heat?,"It has power, but no heat. Which is fine. The last thing I want to pay for is heating a garage. Just keep the snow off in the winter is fine with me."
"Okay. Yeah. Definitely. Okay, some details about the house. Did you have a property inspection done?",Yep. Acme Inspections.
Great. So did they determine the type of heating?,"Yes, forced air. Natural gas."
"Good, and the electrical? Do you know the size of the electrical service?","Yes, it's one hundred amps. But we will be upgrading that right away to two hundred amps. We want to put in a hottub."
Nice! So you will have a licensed electrician take care of that I assume?,Absolutely!
Does the report say what kind of wiring is in the home?,"Yes, it says there is copper and aluminum. About twenty percent aluminum. The rest is copper."
"Oh, aluminum. Aluminum. That could be an issue. How much aluminum did you say?",The report says about twenty percent. Why is it an issue? Every older home in the city has aluminum wiring?
"Yeah, I know, but just last month we've been advised that a couple of our insurance underwriters are no longer insuring aluminum wiring.",Are you serious? So what? People can't get insurance if their house has aluminum wiring? How the hell does that work? You need insurance to get a mortgage?
"I know, I know. It surprised us too.",So what do we do now?
"Well, there are a couple of options. Both of the underwriters we use require an inspection on the wiring. One requires it before possession. The other will give you thirty days after possession to have it done.","Okay, whew. So at least there are options. You had me scared there!"
"Yes. Let's get a few more details, and I can give you a quote from both of them and we'll how this all works out.","Okay, sure."
"The plumbing, are the pipes copper? Pex?",Let me look through this report.
"Sure, take your time.","Okay. It says that the pipes are copper, except for the basement bathroom which has Poly B. Whatever that is."
"right. Poly B? More bad news, I'm so sorry.",For real? What's wrong wtih Poly B? Jeez. I'm a month away from buying a home and you're telling me that I might not be able to insure it? Who makes up these rules?
Most definitely not me! I'm so sorry. Poly B has had incidents of failure. So the same two underwriters have flagged it.,More inspections?
"Unfortunately no. Well, for one of them, they won't insure Poly B at all and the other requires it to be removed within thirty days.",This just gets better and better! Not!
"Okay, lets see what I can do here. Let me check on something, If you don't mind holding I'll get in touch with the underwriter who seems to allow inspections and see what I can find out about the aluminum and Poly B issues.","Yeah, okay. Thanks."
"Okay, thank you for waiting. I've talked an agent from S G A, they underwrite the policies we broker.",Okay.
He's advised me that if you can get an inspection on the wiring by a licensed electrician within thirty days of possession and they certify it as having no issues. That will take care of the aluminum issue. And I told him that you were planning on putting in a new two hundred amp service so that might even be a good time to replace that wiring. But as long as we get the inspection in thirty days that will be all they will require for the electrical.,"Whew, Okay and the plumbing? That Poly B stuff?"
"That's a bit more involved. It all needs to be replaced, but he has agreed to a thirty day window to do that too.","Good grief. All replaced. Well thank God it was just that one new bathroom that has all these issues! My husband can do that easily, Or do they need that to be a licensed plumber? Is this a make work project for all the trades in town?"
It sure seems like it. A lot of wiring and plumbing is going to need to be replaced in the next few years it seemiss This is just new to us too. I'm so sorry you're caught up in it.,Me too! sure takes the glow off buying a new home. Having to rip it apart right away.
Yeah. It must be really frustrating.,"Okay. So, If I get an inspection on the wiring, and replace the Poly B all within the first thirty days. Can I get insurance?"
Yes! That's the good news!,I'll take any good news I can get.
I'll just finish up with the last few questions and get you a quote.,Fingers crossed there's nothing else to trip us up.
"Really, Okay. Do you have a security system? That will give you a discount.","Yes, full security, with camera's, motion sensors, temperature drop, flood. The whole deal."
"Good, just get me a certificate and I'll get the discount.","Good, Okay, yeah, no problem there."
And do you have sewer back up protection?,"Yes, that was installed with that new bathroom, at least it did one good thing! "
"Great, Okay. and finally, the value of the home, what value would you put on replacement?","I think five hundred thousand should do it, for just the home replacement."
"Okay, good, then, we have three options, our Basic which is twelve hundred per year. Our Preferred which is sixteen hundred per year and our Complete which is two thousand per year. Did you know which option you'll be taking?","Yes, The Complete Package, with a five hundred deductible. That's what we had on our previous property. It's good coverage."
"Yes, definitely worth the extra money. Okay. I'll draw up a quote, get those electrical and plumbing clauses and send that over to you for approval.",You have my email address?
"Yes, well I have awilson at gmail dot com. Is that the address I should send the documents to?","Yes, thank you. I'll get them right back to you."
"Thanks Ann, I'll send them today. Thanks for being so patient through this, I'm glad we could find solutions.",Me too! I'll look for those and get them right back. Have a great rest of your day. Bye
