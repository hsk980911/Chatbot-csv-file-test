Rivertown Insurance. This is Scott. How can I be of help?,"#Uh hi, my name is Candy. How's the day going?"
"It's going great, thanks. How's yours going?","Fine, fine, thanks. It's been fine."
"Okay, great. What can I do for you, ma'am?","#Er so I called like a few weeks back, and I spoke with an agent, Mike, I guess, can't really remember now."
"Yeah, agent Mike? Okay?","Yeah, so we like I told him of my desire to insure my car, and he told me of your car package, and subsequently sent me a quote."
"Okay, that's you requested a quote for an automobile policy for you car, right?","Yeah, anyway, I'm interested in the plan, that's why I'm calling."
"Okay, great, so you want to enroll in the automobile plan?","Yes, I want to."
"Alright, good, so which of the plans exactly are you interested in?",I just told you. I want to insure my car.
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Did the agent get to explain the plans under the Automobile policy to you?","Hm, like the Basic Auto and stuff like that?"
"Yeah, the Basic Auto, Preferred Auto and the Complete Auto actually, which all.","Okay, yeah, I remember I chose the Basic plan, but I really do not mind you running me through the plans again, because I really did not get to understand the coverages properly in the email the other agent sent me."
"Oh, sure, no problem. That's why we are here to help you to we are here to advice and help you to make the best decision that suits you. So what part of the policy don't you understand, let's start from there.","Actually, I just need to understand the plans available under the automobile package and how they work, although, basically, based on what the agent sort of explained, I had it in mind to go with the Basic package, but I think if I know how the rest work properly, I will be confident on which to go for, you know?"
"Yeah, I totally understand you. #Uh so starting with the Basic plan, it is the least expensive, costing a thousand dollars a year. So it basically covers the the car owner, that is the driver in events of accidents, you know, like the regular accidents that could happen to anyone. So what the Basic plan does for the driver is that it protects the driver if he or she is held responsible for being the cause of the accident, but the advantage is that it covers the driver regardless of whether he or she actually caused the accident or not, that is, so for instance wait, do you understand all I've just said up to this point?","Yeah, sure, I'm flowing. So, but what if the driver did not cause the accident, what happens?"
"Of course, he or she gets covered. I just mentioned on that, so if a driver is held responsible for an accident, the idea of this plan is to protect the driver from liabilities that may arise from the event. But these liabilities are limited to damages, medical expenses of the injured persons, calculated wages that may have been lost.","Oh yeah, I was just going to ask if it covers the lost wages as well."
"Y-y-yeah, sure, it does, and it goes on to cover other liabilities the driver may incur as a result of the consequences that may have been sufferd by the injured persons in the accident, and all of this protection is granted the driver whether or not, I guess this was what you asked earlier yeah, so the Basic insurance plan provides the driver with all this protection whether or not he or she technically caused the accident he or she is held responsible for. Actually, a lot of people just opt for this without realizing it may not sufficiently cover some incidents they anticipate, but yeah, you have another question concerning the Basic Auto plan or you understand it already?","No, I mean, yeah, I understand it better now. You can go on."
"Alright, great. So the Preferred Auto is the second of the plans. So basically, this one covers the cost of repairs you would expend on your vehicle if you were involved in a traffic accident, and this is available to the driver regardless of whoever is responsible for the accident, I mean either the insured driver or the other driver. It also covers the costs of repairs for any damage done to properties by collision of the vehicle, you know, like with tress, buildings, gates and other things in that category. The best.","#Er wait, sorry, I noticed you mentioned just buildings, trees, gates, and you rounded that off with other things in that category? Could you be more explicit, please?"
"Oh yeah, I mentioned that because items in that category are quite much, but just know that basically, it covers almost any property the vehicle collides with. But if you need better clarification, I could send you a bronchure to see an exhaustive list of the whole ","Oh okay, yeah, you can, but I think I get the idea already."
"Okay, great, great. #Er so I was just going to mention the best part of the Preferred Auto plan. So this plan actually provides a replacement option for the insured, like you know, if the impact of the collision is so bad on the vehicle that it is totaled, like it is totally useless, the insured may actually be up for a replacement with a vehicle of the same market price or a down payment for another vehicle. That's how much the Preferred Auto plan covers and all this coverage is available for just.","#Er that should cost like two thousand dollars, I guess?"
"No, funnily enough, it's comes at just a thousand and five hundred dollars a year. Rivertown Insurance has always sought to make insurance affordable and available to everyone, so you may notice our prices may not be on the high side like our contemporaries.","Hm, I see. But it is a known fact that the premium price might not be an issue, but winning a claim becomes an issue with insurance companies."
"Oh, no, not at all. I cannot speak of other insurance companies, but Rivertown grants claims once it finds the claim to be true and worthy. We hold our clients' best interests at heart, so servicing your needs is our utmost delight. Most people do not come over with concrete evidence or they report late or they do not file the proper documents, so they lose the claim, and they think it's the insurance company trying to eat their money. In fact, we do advise our clients to make use of the service of a lawyer who knows well about insurance. That's to show you how transparent we are.","#Uh okay, so is it just those two plans because I feel like the other agent mentioned something like Auto Comprehensive or is it the Comprehensive Auto now?"
"#Uh I guess you mean the Complete Auto plan, yeah?","Yeah exactly, Complete Auto, my bad. I actually had the same problem the other day with the other agent, and it's surprising the name is quite simple to remember."
"Yeah, it is. Well, that's not a problem. The major thing is you basically understanding what it is about, right? So the Preferred I beg your pardon, the Complete Auto, I mean, just like it's name, covers all incidents arising from both the Basic and Preferred Auto plans. But that's not all, it also covers more incidents like providing for a replacement if the insured vehicle is stolen or d-damaged, you know, by natural disasters like flood and all that. So yeah, that's about the Complete Auto plan, and this goes for the two thousand dollars you mentioned earlier. Seems like you are a two thousand dollar insurance kind of lady, right? .","well, maybe, but nah, I don't think I need the Complete package, I mean Plan, but hearing all these now, I think I would just go for the middle one, that's the the one that costs a thousand five hundred dollars, yeah."
"Oh perfect, that's the Preferred Auto you're talking about. Great, so you're enrolling now, right?","Yeah, I am."
"Great, so I don't think you're an old customer, no?","#Er no, this is actually my first time with your company."
"Oh okay, that's great. So first of all, welcome to Rivertown Insurance where it's a win-win for everyone.","Yeah. thank you, thank you."
"Yeah, so now, I'm just going to get down your details, create an account for you, then I enroll you on the Preferred Auto plan. So ",Okay.

"#Er Candy, could you please slowly spell your last name, Vancouver, right?","Yeah, okay. That's V-a-n-c-o-u-v-e-r, yeah."
"Okay, that's V-a-n-c-u-v-.","No, you actually omitted the o. There's an o before the v, so it's c-o-u, not c-u."
"Yeah, okay okay, my bad. I'm sorry. Got it.",Okay.
