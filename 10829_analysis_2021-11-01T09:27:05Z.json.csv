agent,customer
Good afternoon. Youve reached Rivertown Insurance. This is Darla speaking.,Hello. I'm Greg.
"Hi, Greg. What can I do for you?","I have some questions about adding a dependent to my health insurance policy. My daughter is living across town and shes currently not employed, so I'm helping her through a rough patch. I wondered if Id be able to add her to my health insurance. I don't want to see anything happen to her, but if it does, I want to know shes covered."
"Sure, we can look into that for you. Id be glad to help with that. How old is your daughter?",Does that matter? Shes twenty-three.
"Well, thats great. She has to be under age twenty-six in order to be considered a dependent. There are some other criteria.","Like what? Like I say, she doesn't live with us right now. Would she have to move back in, because I don't think thats going to happen."
"Your daughter lived with you at some time in the past, right?","Sure, she grew up here."
"Ok, that would satisfy the residency requirement.","Does it matter that shes not in school anymore? She got through with college and started working, but she doesn't go to college anymore. She thought about going back, but it looks like shes not going to do that for now."
"No, it's fine that shes not in school.",Will your daughter be filing a joint tax return this year?
No.,Is anyone else claiming her as a dependent?
"No, no one else.",Then she meets the requirements to be put on your health insurance. And on your tax formiss incidentally.
"Oh, I'm glad you said that. That could really help out.","No problem! Just so you know, she would be eligible to be on your health insurance even if you don't claim her for tax purposes."
Really?,"But if you claim her for your taxes, you're required to provide health insurance for her. Is that clear?"
"I think so. So I can put her on my health insurance if I want to, but I have to if I claim her on my taxes?","Yes, thats right."
And it doesn't matter that she has a son?,"No, that doesn't have any bearing on this situation."
"Probably the easiest is to just put her on the same plan as the one you have, but we could go through the different plans available to you if that interests you.","No, lets do easy. I like to do easy. Too much is so hard, you know?"
I know exactly what you mean. I do agree with you there.,Let me pull up your record and we can get her on there. Ill need your name and birthday.
I'm Greg and my birthday is six one seventy-nine.,"I need your full name, Greg."
"Oh, sorry. Sure you do. Of course you do. I'm Greg Gainer.","Alright, and Ive got your birthday. Do you happen to know your customer ID number?"
"Is that on the forms or something? I don't have those right in front of me. I was going to do this online, but I thought itd be easier to just call.","Yes, thats fine. We can get you checked in another way. What's your phone number?"
"Area code two two seven, six one five, three four two five.",And what about your social security number?
"It's five one seven, oh two, three three four nine.",And then I need the answer to your security question. What is your mothers maiden name?
It's Weaver.,"Great, that verifies your account. And we said were going to add your daughter. And her name."
Her name is Gail. Gail Gainer.,And when was Gail born?
"Gail was born December second, nineteen ninety-eight.",And what what about her health? Does she have any medical conditions you're aware of?
She has epilepsy.,Anythinge else?
"No, thats all.","If I wanted to add another dependent in the future, is there a way other than calling this helpline to do that?"
"You can do it online. I prefer to deal with people personally, but thats always another option.",Youre just saying that for the sake of job security.
(laughter) I hadnt thought of it that way. But do you know what I mean? I won't even go into WalMart anymore. You can't see an actual human when you go to cash out.,I do miss interacting with someone as she rings out my groceries. But I imagine all the places are going to go that soon. The Acme store has self-check outs. They even have it at the library.
"Makes you wonder what itll be like in ten years. Well all be talking to machines, all the time.",It's not the same as the human touch. Youre right there. Did you need anything more from me?
"Well, lets see. We got Gail added to your policy. She goes on as of today.",I imagine the price goes up.
Quite right. Your premium will increase thirty-five dollars. At your current level of coverage youll be paying itll be one thousand sixty-seven dollars per month.,And it's less if I pay that per half.
Per half?,I mean if I pay for six months in advance.
"Oh yes, I see what you mean. #Er yes, it's six thousand two hundred ten dollars if you pay six months at a time. Thats a savings of drum roll please one hundred ninety-two dollars.",Drum roll please? (laughter) I knew there was a reason I went with Acceptance.
"Yes, we get you insured and see to it you have fun while you're doing it. Did you want to pay that now?","I could, while were at it. You pro-rate the bill, of course."
Yes. The remaining balance for this six month period and I can do this because you already paid six months ahead is three thousand one hundred and seven dollars.,One hundred and seven? You can't round that off to a nice one oh five?
I can see to it you have fun. Theres only so much I can do (laughter).,Ill take what I can get. I suppose you want my credit card?
That would be nice.,"Ok, ok. Let me get it. Here it is. So I have a Visa. The numbers are two zero one four, five one seven six, eight two three two, four zero one seven."
"So let me make sure Ive got that. You have wo zero one four, five one seven five.",It's six.
I'm sorry?,It's five one seven six.
"Oh, thank you. Five one seven six then, eight two three two, four zero one seven.",And now you want the expiration date and the code on the side.
Youre reading my mind.,Ive always wanted to have a crystal ball in this living room.
"Well with the savings of paying six months up front, youll be able to afford one.",Funny. The expiration is two twenty twenty-five. The actual code is three one seven.
"Ok, Ive got that put into our system. Youre now up to date for yourself and your husband along with your daughter for six months.","Yeah, we adopted her when she was seventeen. Had been through some really hard things. I was glad to be able to be there for her."
I think that about wraps it up. And I'm glad you adopted her if she was having a hard time.,"Shed been homeless and on drugs already, plus some other things besides. Youd never know it today. Shes really thriving."
Thats great. And now shes insured!,Now shes insured.
"That wraps things up on my end, unless you want to know anything else about your policy.","Actually now that you mention it, my tooth has been hurting me. What's the deductible on our dental again?"
"Let me look in here and see. Youre paying seventy-five of it, up to a thousand five hundred dollar cap. Then you have to pick up the rest of it.",Lets hope it's just a filling then.
"I hope so too. And I hope your daughter has better teeth. Or at least, shes not going to cost you right away.",I told you shes adopted. She doesn't have my teeth.
I hope no one has your teeth. What would you do to chew without them?,Ok. I need to get going now. Thanks for all your help today.
"Thank you. Thank you for choosing Rivertown Insurance for all your health needs. You have a great day today, Greg.",Well try. I'm going to go out to the lake and see if I can spot some blue herons. It's something we do together as a family.
