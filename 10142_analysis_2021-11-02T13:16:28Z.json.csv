Yes ma'am we do offer pet insurance plans.,Perfect. Can I get a quote for that? I'm already a customer with you guys and have nothing but good experiences.
Great! I'm glad to hear you're a happy customer. May I have your first and last name?,Yes it's Francis Moore.
"Thank you, Francis! Do you have your customer ID handy?",Let me see if I can find it.
No problem. Take your time.,I found it. It's one two three four five six seven eight.
Thank you for that!,You're welcome.
"For security purposes may I have your date of birth, please?",It's February fourth nineteen fifty.
Great. I've got you pulled up here. To do a pet quote I just have to ask you a couple of questions about your pet. Is that okay?,Sure!
Great! What kind of pet is it?,She's a dog and her name is Sally.
That's a cute name! What kind of dog is she?,She is a dachshund. have you ever had one?
No but they're super cute.,They really are but oh my gosh they are so stubborn. She's just a puppy and she is definitely in charge.
. Well I'm sure she runs the house.,She definitely does .
How old is she?,She is six months old.
So she is just a puppy!,Absolutely.
Do you know about how much she weighs?,She only weighs about eight pounds right now.
Oh that's tiny.,Yeah she's not big at all.
Well with her being so little I would recommend our pet preferred plan.,What does that cover?
It'll reimburse you for all of her vet visits and it offers you a discount on the spay procedure.,That sounds good. How much is that?
It is one thousand per year.,Oh boy. That's more than I expected. Do you have any other plans that are cheaper?
Yes. We do offer the pet basic plan as well for five hundred per year.,That sounds better. What does that cover?
It covers emergency vet visits and routine vaccine reimbursement but does not reimburse for check ups and annual visits.,That's fine. I'm really just looking to cover emergencies.
Then that sounds like it would be the best option for you.,Yes it does. I do have a few other places I want to check. Is it okay if I get back to you?
Absolutely. We have your phone number as eight five two four three six eight seven nine nine. Is that correct?,Yes it is.
Is it okay if I give you a call tomorrow to follow up on your search?,Sure!
Great. Was there anything else that I could do for you today?,I think that's it.
Perfect. There will be a brief survey after the call to evaluate your experience. Would you like to participate?,Yes.
Okay great. The survey will start as soon as I disconnect.,Okay.
Have a great day! Goodbye.,Bye bye.
