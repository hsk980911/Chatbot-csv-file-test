So sorry you're having a long week. Anything I can do to help?,"as a matter of fact there is something you can do. I need to file a claim for my home, you can make it as smooth as possible. I'd appreciate that."
Of course. I'll do just that.,Great.
Can I have your customer number?,Hold a second. I got it saved on my phone.
Okay.,Got it. It's five one nine three three one eight four.

Please confirm the last four numbers of your social security.,Last four numbers. let's see that's one three two eight.
Okay let's get started with filing your claim. What happened to your property?,So I got a call from the police while I was at work that there was a burglary that ended in a shoot-out in my neighborhood.
Oh my God. I hope no one was hurt.,"A neighbor got shot but she's okay. It's just so unbelieveable. I just got back from the precinct right now, my home is an active crime scene with tapes all over. I figured calling my insurer would be the right thing to do."
You did the right thing. I will go ahead and get this filed so I can provide you with a claim number. I can see on your account you've got the home complete policy plan.,Yeah.
"With the home complete policy, you are eligible for an on-the-spot settlement to cover for your additional living expenses as your home is currently an active crime scene.",That would be great. Thank you. You are actually making my day right now.
It's our job ma'am. In the meantime here's your claim number.,Hold please.
Okay.,All set.
"Your claim number is your customer number, a hyphen then your claim ID. So that's five one nine three three one eight four hyphen one seven seven three one.",five one nine three three one eight four hyphen one seven seven three one. Correct?
Right.,So what do I do next?
Let the police do their job while we would be sending an adjuster to visit the precinct to get the police report.,Okay.
He will assess the damages done and estimate the costs.,Okay.
"In the meantime, you have to get a place to stay while the police finish up their investigation.","Thank you so much Alice, you've been really helpful."
Thank you for choosing Rivertown Insurance.,"Whew, I'm so glad I did. ."
You'll have to run an inventory in your house to figure out what was stolen.,I noticed the burglars went away with some cash and jewelry. I'm just glad the kids weren't home.
Thank Goodness.,I've got to run now. Let me know when the adjuster will be coming around so I clear up my schedule.
Definitely. Is there anything else I can help you with?,You've done more than enough. Thank you.
Please take good care of yourself and get some rest.,I will.
