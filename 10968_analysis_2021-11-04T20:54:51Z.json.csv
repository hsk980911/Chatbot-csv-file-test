Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. My name is Cara. How can I help you today?,Hey. I'm calling to change my security info. I keep forgetting the answers and I keep getting locked out.
#Oh. I can help you with that.,"I remember enrolling and choosing the question about my teacher, but I, now I honestly don't remember if I put Missus Sloan or just Sloan."
I understand. Yeah. It goes by what you type in the field. I know what you mean.,Yeah. I need something easier.
Ok. Let's get your account pulled up so I can help you. What's your name?,It's Frank Stiller.
"Ok. Frank, your birthdate?",Five two seventy three.
"Five two nineteen seventy three. Thanks. Now, I would usually ask you one of your security questions, but today, instead, I'll ask for your social. Last four.",Yeah. It's three one five nine.
"Ok. Five nine. Got it. And, can you also verify your zip code?",Nine seven two one four.
Thank you. Ok. Yeah. Looks like you are locked out.,#Yep. So frustrating.
"So sorry for the inconvenience. I'll figure this out for you, though, ok?",Sure. Ok.
"So the list of security questions, do you know what they are?",I just want to go with something easy.
"Well, I think, probably, the easiest one is, yeah, your mother's maiden name? What's your mother's maiden name?",Yeah. Fine. Although I heard that's pretty hackable.
"I can add an additional question to your account, but it would be one more thing to have to remember.","#Uh, fine. I'll have to write it down or I'll forget."
You know what I do?,What's that?
Do you have an iPhone?,Yeah.
I use my notepad.,That's not secure is it?
You can lock the notes you want secure.,Lock them?
"Yes. It's a setting in the Notepad, Notes app.","#Huh. I've never heard of that, but that might work. Most of the time I get locked out of my account at work, because I wrote the stuff down at home."
Right. I get it. Maybe this will work for you.,Ok. I'll give it a try. How do I do it?
Ok. Open up your Notes app.,I'm there.
Create a new note.,Got it.
"Ok, now type in your security questions.",#Oh. I didn't choose the second one.
Ok. No problem. Which one do you want?,The high school.
Ok. What's the name of your high school? Got it.,Lakeside High.
"Ok, I'm going to type in Lakeside High, so make sure that's all you type in also. Ok?",Yeah. Got it.
"Now, once you've typed the questions and answers, look up to the right upper screen and you'll see a circle with three dots.",I see it.
Ok. Select that and then a menu will pop up at the bottom.,Yep.
See the purple lock button?,Yeah.
"Select that and your Face ID thing will flash and then the note will have the lock option. See the unlocked, like, little padlock in the corner?",#Oh. There it is. Yes.
"That's it. Now, when you're done with the note, just tap on the padlock and it will lock. The next time you open the note, you'll see the Face ID thing and it will open.","Nice. I never knew that, I mean, the lock think, not the note thing."
I got it. Yeah. It's convenient.,Ok. Now what?
"Well, I got the name of your high school, but I still need your mother's maiden name.","#Oh right. Marjorie, wait, no, that's her first name. Mayfield."
Ok. Mayfield. Got it. Make sure to add that to your note.,Already did.
"Great! I unlocked your account, so now, you should be able to update your password and log in.",Thanks.
Did you want me to stay on the line with you while you try?,#Nah. It's alright. I'm sure it's fine.
"Ok, then. Is there anything else today?","#Nope. Thanks, again, for the, iPhone tip."
"Sure. No problem. Glad I could help. So, if there's nothing else?",#Mhm.
Have a good day and thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. Take care.,"Thanks, you, too."
Thanks. Good bye.,Bye bye.
