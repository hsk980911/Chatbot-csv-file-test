"Okay, that's easy enough. Your payment is going to change, though.",I figgered it would go up.
Yes. It will be going up by twenty dollars a month.,Twenty bucks! Yikes. This driving thing is going to be expensive I can tell already.
"Well, I suppose it could be.",I'm super glad the rest of my kids have a few years to go.
For Sure.,"First a license, then they wanna borrow the car all the time, then they want a car of their own. What?"
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just going to say that your son is all taken care of.,"Oh thanks, that was pretty fast."
