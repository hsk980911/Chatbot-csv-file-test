"Rivertown Insurance, this is Nathan, how can I help you?",[clears throat] Good morning.
Good morning. What can I do for you?,[clears throat] My husband passed and I'm calling about his life insurance.
#Oh goodness. I'm so sorry to hear of your loss.,Thank you. [clears throat].
Alright. Mrs?,Culver.
"Ok. missus Culver, I'll need to start my asking you a few questions to pull up mister Culver's account.",Ok.
"His first name, please?",Roger.
"Ok. Thank you. Roger Culver. And, his date of birth, please?","Yes, ten seventeen nineteen twenty six."
"Thank you, missus Culver. #Um, October seventeenth twenty six.",Yes.
"Ok. I have his account pulled up. Now, ma'am, to request the death benefit, I'll need to walk you through the request form. Do you have time to do this today?","Well, [clears throat] I'm not sure. How long does it take?"
It'll take about ten to fifteen minutes.,Can you mail it to me or does it have to be done on the phone?
I can mail you the form if you don't have time today.,"Well, I don't have the death certificate yet."
"That's no problem, ma'am. We can get the form submitted without it. You can send us the death certificate as soon as you get it. I can also tell you how to upload it onto our secured site, if that's better for you.","#Oh heavens, no. I don't know how to work a computer."
"No problem, ma'am. I can give you the mailing address before we hang up.","Thank you. [clears throat] Excuse me, I have the sniffles today."
Not a problem. Did you want to work through the death benefit form.,I guess so.
"Ok. Let's get started. The quicker we start, the quicker we'll be finished, right?",True. Yes.
Ok. I need to ask you some sensitive questions. Are you ready.,Yes.
"#Um, ok, I have mister Culver's policy number, date of birth, address, and social. I need date, location, and cause of death, please.",Ok. He died [clears throat] last Thursday in Saint Louis Missouri. What else?
Cause of death.,Right. #Um stroke.
"Ok. And, you said you don't have the death certificate yet, correct?",That's correct.
Thank you. Was he confined to a hospiatl at the time of his death?,No. He died at home.
I'm so sorry.,Thank you.
"Ok, do you have the list of physicians or practitioners who attended or prescribed for mister Culver within two years of his death.","Yes. He only had one doctor. Same one for over fifty years. Doctor Smith. Ben, Benjamin."
Got it. Doctor Benjamin Smith.,Yes.
"Thanks. And, what were the names of any medications prescribed for your husband within the five years before he passed.",He wasn't on any medications. Healthy as an ox.
Wow. Amazing. He was ninety five?,"Yes, sir."
"That's a long full life, #huh?",Yes. He was blessed. We both were. .
Yes. Ok. missus Culver just a few more questions. Did your husband smoke in the past three years?,No.
Good. Thank you.,Mhm.
"Now, you have the option to receive the benefit in one lump sum or processed over.",One lump sum is fine. I have a financial person who'll help me with it.
Sounds good. Thank you for confirming. Now a few more things and we'll be finished.,Ok.
"Since you are requesting the forms through the mail, it may take a bit longer to get the benefit to you.",That's ok. I'm in no hurry.
Ok. Good. I've entered the information you've confirmed today and I will get this off to one of our underwriters.,Today?
"Yes, ma'am. Just as soon as we get off the phone.",Ok.
They will review the information and send out a packet to you to the mailing address on mister Culver's policy.,Ok.
Is that a good mailing address for you?,Yes. I'll be going to my daughter's house in Oklahoma next month. Will it get to me by then.
"#Oh, yes. We will FedEx it to your home within the next week.",Good. Ok.
"Now, once you get the packet, you'll find an enclosed prepaid envelope to return the forms and death certificate.",Ok.
One of the forms has to be signed by his physician. #Um Doctor Smith.,"#Oh, gosh. That's a ways from my house. #Hm, I think I can have my neighbor take me."
"Ok. Another option is that if you have Doctor Smith's fax number, we can fax the form directly to him.",Ok. Hold on. I need to get my address book. I have it in there.
Ok. Take your time.,"Smith. Here it is. Dr. Smith. #Um, fax. Here. Four o. two, seven seven four, six nine zero one."
"Four o. two, seven seven four, six nine zero one?",Yes.
Good. I'll have the underwriter get that over to him as soon as possible.,That'll be easier for me. Thank you.
"My pleasure. Ok. #Uh, once you get all your documentation together, use that prepaid envelope and send it back to us. Once we receive the information, the underwriter will process a check to you. If you'd prefer an electronic transfer of the benefit, there is a form in the packet that you can fill out to process it that way.",Oh. Ok. My daughter can help me with that part.
Great. I'm glad you have help. This is a difficult time.,It sure is. Thank you.
"So, missus Culver, we're all done for now. Do you have any questions?","No. But, I'll get the packet soon?"
"Yes, within the week.",Ok. Thank you.
"And, again, ma'am, I'm so very sorry for your loss.","You're kind. Thank you, dear."
My pleasure. You take care of yourself now. Bye.,Will do. Thank you. Bye.
