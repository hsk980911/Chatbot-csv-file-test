Then you can make payment by clicking on the make payment icon.,Okay. I'll click on the make payment icon. Got it.
Then you have two options. You either make payment directly from your bank or through your credit card.,Okay. alright. Is that all?
"Yes, that's all. Is there anything I can help you with?",Definitely not. I think that's all.
