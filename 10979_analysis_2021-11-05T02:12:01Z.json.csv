"Hi, my name's Antonio. Thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance. How can I help you?",Hey there. I'm calling about changing my plan.
"Ok. And, which plan do you have, which plan do you want to change?",I've got life insurance with you.
Ok. I'll need to pull up your account. Can I get your full name?,"Sure, it's Kiki Winthrup."
"Kiki, is that short for something else?","#Oh, jeez, I always forget to say my real name. Sorry. It's Kathleen, but my middle name's Nicole, so they started calling me Nicki, which turned into Kiki."
"No problem. Kathleen Winthrup. Kiki, what's your birthdate?","February sixth, nineteen ninety seven."
"Thank you. Ninety seven. Good. Can I, I need to verify your account by asking you one of your security questions.",Ok.
What's the name of your high school?,Welsh Mountain High.
Perfect. Thanks.,#Mhm.
"So, I see you have a Term Life policy with us and you said you wanted to change it, correct?","Yes, I want the one where you can borrow money against it."
"Sure. Yes, you can borrow money against the total amount you've contributed on the day of the loan request. Make sense?",Yes. That's what I need.
"Ok, sure. I can do that. Give me one minute.",Ok.
"Ok, so for the Universal Life, there's a bit more extensive application process, but it shouldn't be a problem.",Ok. What do you need?
"I'll just need to send you an application, which will have a few health questions and then that application goes to our underwriters.",Ok. Do you send it to me in the mail?
"No, I can send it to you, in, well, it will be an email with a link to your dashboard where you'll see your documents and it'll be in there.","Ok, so I can fill it out online?"
"Yes. Once the underwriters have the application if there is anything they need to talk with your doctors about, they get authorization from you first to get your medical records.",Ok. I don't really see doctors all that much. Just like if I need antibiotics or something.
"No problem. Then they, probably won't need to do that, but just in case, I'm letting you know what the process is, ok?",Yeah. Ok.
"After the underwriters review your application, they may want to do a quick medical questionairre with you over the phone, but we won't know until after you fill out the application.","Ok, how long does it all take?"
"Right now, the process is running about four to six weeks.",#Oh. #Wow. That seems like a long time.
"I know, but with COVID and all, the underwriters are busy right now.","#Oh. I get it. No worries. As long as my other policy is good while I'm applying for this other one, I'm good."
Yes. Your other policy will be in tact throughout the application process.,Cool. Thanks.
"Sure. Now, I need to verify your email address.","Sure. It's k.i.k.i. like my name, loves ham at gmail."
Kiki loves ham?,#Yep. All true.
Funny. Thanks. One minute.,Sure.
"Ok. I've verified your email address and send the link to you to the application. After you submit the application, there's nothing else to do except wait for the underwriter to contact you and that might take a while right now.",I understand. Ok.
"If you have any questions during the process, you can call me. My extension is listed in the email I just sent.",Cool. Thanks.
Sure. Is there anything else I can do for you today?,Can you tell me how much more it's going to be a month?
"#Oh, no problem. One second.",#Mhm.
It will be nine hundred more per year.,"Ok, so it went from three hundred a year to, what? Twelve hundred?"
Correct.,Ok. That's about what I thought it would be.
Great. Do you have any more questions?,"I read online that the coverage is three hundred thousand, right?"
"#Um, yes. Yeah, that's right.","Ok. Thanks. I'm all good, now."
"Great and, again, if you have any, questions, just give us a ring.",Alright. Thanks.
Thanks again for calling Rivertown Insurance. Have a great day!,"Thanks. You, too."
Bye.,Bye bye.
