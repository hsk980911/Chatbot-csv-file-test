Thank you. I've got you pulled up here. Can you give me a run down of what happened?,Yeah I was travelling down highway eighty nine and I was stopped at a red light.
Mm-hmm.,Then out of nowhere this guy just rams into me. I guess he was texting or something.
Was anyone injured in the accident?,No everyone was fine thankfully.
That's good to hear. What kind of damage was done to your vehicle?,It looks like the entire bumper was smashed in and there are scratches all over the trunk.
Okay. Did the airbags deploy?,No.
Okay that's good to hear. Were you able to get the other driver's information.,I sure was.

Thank you sir.,You're welcome.
Okay sir. I've got all of the information logged in our system.,Okay what do I do now?
"Once you get the police report, if you want the damage to be covered you'll need to file a claim.",How do I do that? Do I call in?
Yes sir. You can call in or you can file the claim on our website.,That sounds easier than having to hold. Where is that on the site?
Once you log in it's in the upper left hand corner. It says file a claim.,Okay. That sounds pretty simple.
"If you'd like sir, I can go ahead and start it and then you could upload the police report later.","No, that's okay. I don't really feel like getting into all of that right now."
I understand sir.,I think I'll just log in when I get home to do it.
That's not a problem sir. Was there anything else I could do for you today?,No I think that's everything for right now.
"Okay, great. Again I'm sorry to hear about the accident.",Yeah it's kind of crazy. You never expect it to happen.
Oh I know. All of our customers say that they didn't see it coming.,I can definitely relate now .
