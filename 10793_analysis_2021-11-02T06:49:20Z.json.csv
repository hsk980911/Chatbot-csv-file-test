"Good morning! This is Rivertown Insurance, what can I do for you today?","Hi, I just needed to make some changes to my account?"
"Hello, my name is Carlos, and I would love to help you with your policies.","Oh, thanks."
"First, let's take a look at your account, okay?","Yeah, okay."
"Can I get your full name, please?",My name is Savannah Downrimple.
Is that D-o-w-n-r-i-m-p-l-e?,"Yes, just as it sounds."
"Thanks for verifying that. Okay then, we just need your date of birth and policy number.","The birthdate is October twenty first, nineteen eighty-one-."
Uh-huh.,And the policy number? Where would I-where would I find that?
If you have a statement handy you would find it-.,"No, I do online billing."
"Okay, then. #Um, if you go into your online account-.","I don't know how-I mean, my password's at home so I don't have my password."
"Oh, yes. I understand. Okay, well, there are other ways we can access your account?",Okay.
"I would just need to verify some additional information. A social security number, phone number, and question to security question.","Oh, okay. We can do that."
Great! What's the social?,You need the whole thing or just the last four digits?
"The entire number, miss Downrimple.","Please, call me Savannah."
"Okay, Savannah. #Uh, we need the entire number in order to access the account.",For security?
Yes. You could always call back later or access our online account if you're not comfortable giving out-.,"No, no. It's fine. I just wanted to know if you needed-needed the whole thing or not."
"Great. Okay, I'm ready for the number.","It's, let's see here. It's five-five-five, two-six-, five-five-five-two."
"Great. Okay, I just need the phone number we have on file now.","A lot of protection, huh?"
Yes. As we have very sensitive information-.,I'm just giving you a hard time.
"Oh, okay.","Yeah, I'm just kidding you. The phone number is eight-zero-one-."
Uh-huh.,"Four-six-two, five-five-five-two."
Thank you for verifying that number. And finally-.,Finally! .
"Yes, lastly we just need the answer to the security question-.","Okay, shoot. I'm ready."
What is the name of your first pet.,"Oh, that would be my dog, Leo. He was a poodle-maltese mix."
"Thank you answering the question we are now able to make changes to your account. I appreciate your patience while I got everything, verified.",You don't need anything else? DNA? Last date of menstrual cycle? .
"#Uh, no.","I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What was your name?"
Carlos.,"I'm just a loud type, Carlos. No worries-no worries."
"Okay. Great. #Um, so what changes did you need to make to your account?","Well, I need to drop someone who's been on my insurance."
I can certainly assist you with that process. It looks like both Dean and Koshi are on your account?,Yes. Dean's my husband and Koshi's my daughter. She's getting married so her husband's going to add her to his insurance.
"Oh, yeah. I guess you won't' be needing her on yours anymore then.","No, and I know she's only nineteen-."
Uh-huh.,But I think her fiance is a real nice guy. And getting her off my insurance doesn't hurt either .
"Yes, I think it will bring down your policy cost quite a bit.","That's what I want to hear! Gotta pay for the wedding, you know?"
It's always nice to save a little-.,"Yeah, she wants this BIG wedding, and I'm like, seriously? I was hoping this whole covid thing would make it so they'd do one of those Zoom weddings? That's my budget, a Zoom wedding ."
"Yeah, I can see how-.",So how much will I save?
"Currently, having a teen on your account increases your Basic Auto policy by fourteen hundred annually.",Yes! So what will my new bill be?
"After dropping Koshi from your account, you are looking at a new payment of, one moment while the computer updates.",This is exciting! Should I do a drull roll .
It looks like your new payment will be-.,Drull roll .
"#Um, it will be one thousand dollars annually. That will decrease your current autopayment to eighty-four dollars a month.","Are you kidding me? That's like, half of what I'm paying now."
"Yes, your new payment will be reflected on your autopay billing date of the first of August.","Do I get, like, a refund for the week left that my daughter won't be on the policy?"
"Unfortunately, no. If you were to ask for a refund, we would prorate it, but would have to ask for a seventy-five fee for ending the policy before the due date, so the prorate refund would actually be less than the seventy five dollar fee, so it would -.",It would actually cost me money.
"That's correct, ma'am.","Please, call me Savannah."
"That's correct, Savannah.","Thank you, Juan."
My name is Carlos-.,"Oh! I'm so embarassed. Thank you, Carlos."
No worries!,I guess-I guess it would give Koshi time to get on her husband's account and everything. A week isn't bad.
"Great. I'm glad it's going to work out okay for you. While I have you on the line, have you ever considered bundling your auto insurance with one of our three home policy plans?","Oh, no, Carlos. I don't have time for that today. Maybe I call back on another day and hear all of your spiel, okay?"
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to take up your time-.,"You have been very helpful and I thank you. I just gotta go now, you know?"
Totally understand. You will be receiving confirmation of your changes to the email we have on file.,The talkybird at one two three dot com email?
"Yes, that's what we have on file for you, Savannah.","Oh good! You finally called me by my name. I hate all that missus and ma'am stuff. Makes me feel old. I'm only fourty, you know?"
I'm glad I could be of help to you today. Thank you for calling Rivertown. Have a great rest of your day. And good luck with the wedding!,"Well, I'll need it. Thanks again to you."
Good bye.,Bye for now.
