agent,customer
"Hello, this is Rivertown Insurance. How can I help you today?",Hi yes I I'm new to my area and I need to find me a new local insurance agent.
"Sure, I can help you with that.","Great, thanks."
"Sure, no problem, what is your zip code?",It's it's seven oh oh two nine.
"Seven zero zero two nine, is that correct?","Yes, that's it."
"Great, thank you. One moment while I find the agents local to your area.","Sure, thanks. I really appreciate you guys. I've been with Rivertown Insurance awhile, but since moving I wanted to get an agent that was local to my area."
"Thank you, I appreciate those kind words and I completely agree that it's super helpful to have someone local to work with.",Oh for sure. We had a hailstorm right before we left our old house and it was such a mess but it was better having a local agent to work with than someone out of town.
"Oh goodness, I hope you don't have to deal with a another hailstorm anytime soon.",Me either.
"So, I have a list of three agents local to your area.","Oh that's great, thanks."
"Sure, no problem. We typically reach out to those agents and have them directly contact you. Is that okay with you?","Yeah, that's fine. I'm not in any rush."
I'll get your information to them and they should be in contact with you within the week.,"Oh, that would be great."
"Sure, no problem. Would you prefer them contacting you by phone or email?",Oh I guess either is fine with me.
"Okay, then let me verify your contact information.",Sure thing.
"Okay, first off, what is your first and last name?",I guess that would be helpful. It's John Harkins.
John Harkens spelled h. a. r. k. e. n. s?,"Oh no sorry, it's h. a. r. k. i. n. s.."
"Oh, thank you mister Harkins. What is your email address?","Yeah, it's John Harkins, j. o. h. n. h. a. r. k. i. n. s. dash eight two at hotmail dot com."
"Okay, so johnharkins dash eight two at hotmail dot com?","Yep, that's correct."
"Great, and what is your phone number?",three five four eight eight nine nine.
Three five four eight eight nine nine?,"Yes, that's it."
And what is your area code?,"Oh sorry, I forgot to add that, it's two oh two."
Two zero two?,Yes.
"Great, thank you. So within a week, you should be contacted by these local agents either by email or phone and.","Wait, the more I think about it, can you have them only use email? I've got kids and afternoon naps and all that jazz."
"Sure thing, let me make a note here for them to contact you only by email.",Great thanks.
No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,I don't think so. I'll just be watching for those emails.
"Okay, that sounds great, sir. If you don't mind, after I end this call there will be a short survey about the service you received today.","Okay, I'll hang around for it."
Thank you. Have a great day.,Thanks you too.
Bye-bye.,Bye.
