"Okay, I can help you with that.",I mean I've tried a few times now. It should be rufus dog fifty seven with a period at the end but I.
"Here, let me get.",Now it says I've tried too many times. I don't have time for this.
"Okay, I can help you with that.","I hate these stupid password rules, you know? You have to have a capital letter, you have to have a."
"Sir, if I can just get your first.",it's ridiculous. You need my what?
Could I get your first and last name? Then I can help you get into your account.,"Yeah, okay, I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated."
"I completely understand, sir.","Alright, okay. Anyway, my name is John Cartier."
"John, how do you spell your last name?",c.a.r.t.i.e.r.
"Thank you, one moment please. Could I get your date of birth?",May twelfth of sixty two.
"Alright, that was May twelfth of nineteen sixty two. Got it. Hang on a minute here while I pull that up.",Okay.
"Alright, I've got it here. I just need the last four digits of your social.",My what?
The last four digits of your social security number.,"Oh, yeah, eight eight four two."
Thank you. That was eight eight four two.,Yeah. Why do you need my social?
"Oh, I just need to make sure it's really you that's calling. You know, for verification purposes.","Oh, okay, that makes sense."
"So, I've pulled up your account. Yeah, I can see that you're locked out for trying too many times.","Oh, great. Now what do we do?"
Don't worry. I can reset that password for you so that you can get back into your account.,"Okay, good. Thanks!"
No problem. Hang on here while I get that set up for you.,Okay. This time I'm going to write it down! I can't keep track of all these passwords.
It can definitely get confusing. It's a good idea to write it down in a safe place.,Yeah.
"Okay, are you, near your computer right now?","Yeah, it's right here in front of me."
Great! You're going to receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password.,Okay.
Let me know when you see that come in.,Okay. Let me bring my email up here.
Alright.,This might take a while. My computer is a little old.
That's okay. No rush.,"Alright, uh, I'm looking here. Nothing yet."
"Okay, no problem.","Oh, here we go. I see it. Now what?"
"So when you open that email, you'll see a link to reset your password. Do you see the link?","Okay, oh, here it is."
"Yeah, just click on that link.","Okay, I just clicked on it. Okay, now I see where it wants me to put in my username."
Right. Do you know your user name?,"Yeah, it's my email address. I'm putting that in now."
"Okay, great. Then just hit that submit button.","Okay, I just did that. Uh, okay. Oh, I see, it just wants me to create a new password."
Exactly. Go ahead and come up with a new password. You'll need to enter it twice there.,"Okay, uh, let me think for a minute. I already used my dog's name, so I can't do that. Uh, oh I know."
"Yeah, just anything that you think you'll remember.","Uh, I got to think of something here."
One way to do it is look around you and name two objects that you see.,"Huh, that's a good idea. I see a toaster and a box of cereal."
"Okay, then just think of a number to put with that. Add a symbol.",Symbol? What's a symbol?
"You know, like an exclamation point, or the dollar sign, the percent sign.","Oh, yeah, okay. I've got it."
"Great, once you enter that twice, hit that submit button.","Okay, I just did that. Now it wants me to log in."
"Right, so now you can log in using that new password and you should be good to go.","Awesome. Okay, let me make sure I get in before I let you go."
"No problem. Yeah, we want to make sure this works for you.","Okay, I'm in! Thank you so much!"
You're so welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?,"No, that's it. Thank you for your help!"
"No problem sir, have a great rest of your day.",You too!
Thanks. Goodbye.,Bye.
