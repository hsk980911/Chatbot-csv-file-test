#Uh there we are hi there thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance you're speaking with Rob. How can I help you today?,"#Um yeah good thanks, how are you?"
"I'm great, thank you for asking. What can I do for you today?","#Um I'm just getting in touch because I actually want to cancel my automobile insurance plan. I googled how to cancel the plan and it said to call this number, is that correct?"
"Yes sure is, and I can definitely help you with that. Can I start with your first name and last name?","My first name is Regina, Earle. e. a. r. l. e."
Fantastic Regina. I'll also need your date of birth and your eight digit customer number if that's alright.,"Yep my birthday is the fourteenth of August nineteen seventy two, and I'll just have to look that up, where's tha- is that in the booklets you sent in the mail?"
Yes you'll be able to find that right at the top of any letters we've sent you.,"Great, let me just- wow, you guys do send a lot of letters! Alright, here it is, you ready?"
Yes!,Okay so it's three nine nine.
"Yep, three nine nine.",Two seven six five three.
"Gotcha, thanks Regina. While you've got that paperwork out, do you happen to have your policy number? Just need that to locate your current plan.",Yes I do let me just rummage right yes so that's.
Hold on a moment there please ma'am.,Oops sorry!
"Sorry about that, ready for the number when you're ready.",So my policy number is thirty six forty four.
Thirty six forty four.,ninety four twelve.
"ninety four twelve. Alright Regina thanks for all that information. So I can see you currently hold our Complete Auto plan type, just confirming you would like me to cancel this plan for you today?",Yes exactly.
"So just so you are aware, as you are not within our cooling off period, you will have to pay an early cancellation fee of fifty dollars.","Fifty dollars? Sorry, what cooling off period?"
"You will find all this information in the information pack given to you when you initiated your insurance policy, but essentially you have thirty days after your policy is issued or renewed to make a cancellation without any fees.",Uh-huh.
You are also able to decline our annual offer to renew your policy without any fees being charged. It's just unfortunately our policy that cancellations outside of the cooling period will have to incur a small fee of fifty dollars.,"Uh-huh. Well I certainly didn't expect that, I'm actually cancelling my insurance policy because I'm selling my car. Do you have any arrangements that offer an understanding for my situation?"
"#Um unfortunately not, the procedure is quite rigid when it comes to waiving cancellation fees.",Okay. Well that is disappointing.
Are you selling your car to buy another one?,"Not immediately, but sometime in the future I do plan to buy another one."
"Well of course you do have the option to keep your current policy and we can quickly and easily transfer the policy over to your new car free of charge, would you be interested in that?","#Uh yeah except I can't be sure exactly when I'll be buying the car and I don't think I can afford to extend the insurance without a car. #Um look I still think it's best to cancel it, and I'll ring back up when I need to, is that alright?"
Yes of course. So you are happy to cover the cancellation fee today ma'am?,"Yes , I guess that'll be fine."
"Alright great. That'll be charged to the credit account we have on file today, ending in four three two six, is that correct?","Alright, fine."
"Okay so just so you know ma'am, your plan service will remain in place until the end of this month so you do have a small buffer period. You will not be charged for the next billing period. Do you confirm the cancellation of your automobile insurance plan today?","Yes, thanks, I confirm to cancel the plan."
"Alright great, please hold the line for one moment ma'am while I process that into the system.",Sure.
"Okay so that's done, your plan with us is now canceled. Please don't hesitate to get in touch before the end of the month if you change your mind about transferring your policy to a new vehicle.","Sure thing, thanks."
"So, is there anything else I can help you with today?","Nope, that's all from me. Thanks for your help."
"Not a problem. I hope you have a fantastic day, thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance.","Cheers, you too."
Bye now.,See ya!
