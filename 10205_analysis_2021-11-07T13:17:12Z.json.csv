"Yes, go ahead miss Alexander.",Four three seven five two one six five seven.
I am going to repeat that back to you. Four three seven five two one six five seven.,That is correct!
"Okay, now the address where your car will be garaged? Where will your car be parked when your not driving it?","Oh okay my address. It's four twenty-nine South Abbot Lane, Tolson, Ohio four three eight one two. And that's where my mail comes too."
"Great! That was my next question. Okay so the address is four twenty-nine South Abbot and that's A B B O T Lane, Tolson, Ohio four three eight one two, correct?",Yep you got it!
"Okay, now can you look and tell me what kind of car will you be driving miss Alexander?",okay I got it here somewhere I just had it. Oh right here it is. Right in front of me. Okay it is a two thousand twenty Red Chevrolet Cobalt. Is that what you needed?
"Yes, I just need one more thing off of that title you have in your hand. Is it possible for you to read me the VIN number for the vehicle?","normally I would say no but, I grabbed my glasses and they are like looking through a magnifying glass honey . Are you ready it is really long?"
"Yes, I am ready go ahead.",Four three A five six three two six B A four two nine three one two five you get all that?
"I sure did but, I am going to read it back to you okay?",Go ahead dear.
"Four three A five six three two six B A four two nine three one two five, correct?",Yay we got it!
"Those are some long numbers I know. Do you happen to have your driver's license nearby to give me your license number, issuing state, and expiration date off of them?",I do. Hold on. Okay I got them here. Oh here in Ohio. My number is R L nine one five five one six and I have to get them by two thousand twenty-three.
Okay great! What phone number would you like for me to put on your account miss Alexander?,Oh mhm just put eight one three four two seven six five three two that's my daughter's she answer's the phone for me most of the time.
"Okay, that's fine. And do you know what kind of coverage you are looking for today? Are you wanting full coverage or only what the law requires?",Well I only want what I have to have to drive that's all nothing else okay?
"Okay, I can do that for you. And, will you be paying your bill monthly or would you prefer to pay every three months?",mhm well how much will it be?
I am looking at only what your state requires and that will be a total of two hundred forty dollars for the policy.,Oh my god two hundred forty dollars a month!
Oh no ma'am no ma'am. That is for the full policy which is for six months. So you divide that up for six months and it would be about forty dollars a month.,Oh my god you almost gave me a heart attack there!
I am so sorry.,Oh it's okay. You should say it will be forty dollars a month before you tell me two hundred and forty dollars [laughter.
Yes you are right. I should lead with the monthly payment first. I will do that next time. Thank you for the kind advice! So does that sound okay?,Well how much would it be if I got full coverage? That would buy me a new car if something happened right?
"Yes. That would cover your vehicle if you were at fault and cover your vehicle if someone else was at fault and did not have insurance or not enough insurance. So either way, yes your car would be covered.",But that first one the forty dollars that wouldn't buy me a car huh?
Well it would not cover a replacement vehicle it really just covers the other vehicle involved in the accident.,Okay well how much for the one that would help me get a new car then?
It looks like that one would be oh I just about did it again and said the higher number first it would be about fifty seven dollars a month for full coverage for you miss Alexander.,Oh okay that's what I want then. The fifty seven dollar one.
Okay and how do you want to be billed for that? Do you want monthly payments or every three month payments?,mhm well I better stick with every month I guess.
"Okay, so your first payment will not be due for seven days okay? But you will have to make that payment by the end of the seven days or your coverage will cancel with no grace period okay?",Grace period. What do you mean grace period?
"A grace period is at the end of a billing cycle when your payment is due most policies still give you around ten days to pay before cancelling your policy but, since this is your first payment you won't have that grace period yet.",Oh okay that's okay that's okay. I will pay it on Friday. Is that okay to do it on Friday?
"Yes, miss Alexander that will be just fine.",I will do it Friday then.
Okay miss Alexander. I would like to go over what we did today okay?,That's fine. Sure!
Okay. We opened a policy for you for your two thousand twenty Red Chevrolet Cobalt for full coverage insurance.,"Yes, that's right."
We also set you up for monthly payments on that policy with your first payment being due within seven days.,And I'm gonna pay that Friday.
Yes ma'am I have it noted here that you will be paying your initial payment on Friday. I just want to go over your address and phone number to make sure we have the correct contact information for you okay?,Yeah my address is oh did you want to say it?
"I can give it to you and you can just give me a yes if it's correct okay. I have four twenty-nine South Abbot Lane, Tolson, Ohio four three eight one two as the address and Four three seven five two one six five seven is the phone number for your daughter to get in touch with you, correct?","Yes, that all sounds right to me! ."
"Okay, well is there anything else that I can help you with today miss Alexander?",No you did a good job okay. Tell your manager that!
