"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I can help you change your payment method if you need to.","Right, yes, that'd be great."
"Okay, so, you said your name was John Dale, right? Is that Dale with a D?","Right, d.a.l.e."
"Thank you. May I have your birth date and customer number please, John?",Date of birth is May five nineteen seventy-one.
"Okay, thank you.","Just a minute, I need to lookup my customer number, sorry."

"Two five six seven one three three two two one, got it.",Right.
And your social security number please?,Four five two.

"Thank you very much, John.",You're welcome.
So I see here you're currently set up to pay with a card ending in four four three two.,"Right, that's the one I had stolen, so can I just give you the new number?"
"Absolutely, or if you want you can also set it up to take the payment straight from your bank like how how you would get your paycheck, you know?",Oh okay. I didn't know that.
That information would be a lot harder for someone to steal so if you want to do that it might work better for you.,"Yeah, sure. I just just need to look up I guess my routing number and all?"
"Yes sir, I'll need your bank account type, account number, and routing number if you want to do that.","Yeah okay, just a minute then."
