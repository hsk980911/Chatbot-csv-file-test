agent,customer
Good morning. Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. My name is Sandra. How may I help you this morning?,"I, I'm thinking of getting pet insurance and wanted to get a quote. Kinda feeble, huh?"
"No, sir. Not at all. We have a lot of people who insure their pets. What's your name?","#Um, Keith Trevino."
And what kiind pets do you have?,Does it matter? I have two dogs and a cat.
"No, the kind of pets don't matter. But for some reason we're required to ask.","#Um, I see."
"So, do you want to insure all three animals?","That kinda depends on, the cost."
That's fine. We just need to choose one for now.,"Ok, let's do the dog."
Sounds good. What kind of dog is it?,She's an English Springer Spaniel.
And how old is she?,"She was born New Year's Eve twenty fifteen. So that, makes her five years and, seven months."
And her weight?,I'd guess about sixty five pounds.
"Okay, well let's discuss the types of policies available. We have two policies, the Petcare Basic policy and the Petcare Preferred policy.","Uh, yeah, okay, I wasn't expecting more than one. Let me think a minute."
"Of course, just let me know when you're ready.","Well, I guess it's kinda going to depend on what the cost is and what's in each policy."
I can go over that with you mister Trevino. Let's start with the Petcare Basic policy. Some companies call this their Maximum Benefit Policy.,I've heard of that.
"Well, then, you may already be aware of what's covered. Would you still like me to explain it?","#Uh, yeah, that would be great."
"Alright, our Petcare Basic policy is renewable every one two months. It includes vet fees for sudden and unexpected injury or illness. Each injury or condition is covered up to a maximum amount following the initial claim.","Wait, what was that? Something about maximum something?"
"Yes, sir. Each injury or condition is covered up to the maximum benefit following the initial claim.","What, what does that mean?"
"It means that, after the initial claim, we'll continue to pay the vet bills until your maximum benefit is reached. For example, if your maximum benefit is two thousand dollars, after the initial claim we would pay the vet bills until they reached two thousand dollars. After that, they would be your responsibility.","What, what about, what did you call it, the initial claim?"
"That would be covered, but wouldn't count toward your maximum benefit. For example, still using the two thousand dollar maximum benefit, if your first visit to the vet cost one thousand seventy five dollars, we would cover it. And you would still have the maximum benefit of two thousand dollars on visits after that.","So, let me, guess. Your, maximum benefit is two thousand dollars. ."
"No, mister Trevino. That was just an easy figure to use.","Then, what is your, maximum, benefit?"
It's three thousand five hundred dollars with the Petcare Basic policy.,How much did you say that basic policy cost?
It's five hundred dollars a year?,All at once?
"Either that, or you can choose direct payment and pay it monthly.","What do you mean, by, direct payment?"
"You would give us the information for your bank, or, for a credit card and we would automatically take the money each month.","#Uh, I see. Didn't you say, that there was, another policy?"
"Yes, sir, there is. It's called the Petcare Preferred policy. Would you like information for that plan, as well?","Is that because your customers, prefer it? Sure, let's hear it."
"I'm not sure I know the answer to that question. But anyways, the preferred plan covers everything the basic plan does. The biggest difference is that the maximum amount resets each year.","#Um, what?"
"Back to the two thousand dollar maximum limit, the initial visit is not included in it, but instead of a straight two thousand dollars and then we don't pay anymore, the two thousand dollars resets at the beginning of the next year. So that means, if your follow-up visits cost three thousand dollars in the first year, you would be responsible for one thousand dollars. But the next year, instead of having to continue paying everything yourself, we would once again, cover the first two thousand dollars.","I, I think I've got it. So, after that first visit, if the total cost, spread out over, three years, and it was, say, four thousand dollars, you guys would cover the first two thousand each year."
"That's right, mister Trevino.","Okay, well, how much would that one cost me?"
The cost of the Petcare Preferred policy is one thousand dollars a year.,"Is the, what, did you call it, the, maximum benefit still whatever it was before?"
"No, sir. The maximum benefit for the basic policy is three thousand five hund dollars. And for the preferred policy it's three thousand dollars each year.","Wait a minute. #Uh, it's higher for the, basic plan than the, preferred?"
Yes it is. But you have to remember that with the preferred plan it resets each year.,"Oh, yeah. I see."
Is there any other information I can provide?,"Can I, pay this one, monthly?"
"Certainly, as long as it's direct payment. So, would you like to set your pets up with their own policies?","Not, not right now. This is, going to take some thought. I tried to, write evrything down, but, I may have missed something."
"If you'd like, sir, I'd be happy to send you an email with the information. I'll just need your email address.","#Uh, yeah, that would probably be, best."
"Okay, that's easy to take care of. What's your email address?","It's, k. t. six three seven five at tmail dot com."
"Okay, let me make sure I have it right. That's k. t. six three seven five at tmail dot com.",Yeah.
"Okay, if you'll wait a moment, I'll get that email on its way.","That's, great. Thanks a lot."
It's no problem. And the email is on its way. Is there anything else I can do for you this morning?,"No, no thank you. Not right now. But, if I have more questions, I, can I call back?"
"Certainly, mister Trevino. Call us anytime between the hours of eight a.m. and seven p.m., Monday thru Friday. We'll be here.","Okay, then. Sounds good."
"If that's all, mister Trevino, I'll say good-bye for now. When you're ready to get those policies, be sure to call back. Someone here will be happy to help you.","Oh, I will. And, thanks for the help. #Um, 'bye now."
"Good-bye, mister Trevino.","#Um, 'bye."
