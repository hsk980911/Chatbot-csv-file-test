agent,customer
Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. How may I help you today?,Yeah. You guys are overbilling my account and I'm sick of it. You need to fix it.
I'm sorry to hear you're frustrated. I'd be more than happy to look into this for you.,Fine.
May I have your first and last name?,Yes. It's Jason Brown.
"Thank you, Jason. Do you have your customer ID handy?",No. Do you think I'd take the time to memorize that?
That's okay sir. We can verify you a different way.,Okay.
May I have your date of birth and phone number associated with the account?,It's five twenty nine nineteen eighty eight.
Mm-hmm.,And the phone number is eight five zero four four nine eight two three four.
Thank you for that information. May I have your social security number?,It's four four two three seven four five six eight.
And for security purposes can you verify your mother's maiden name?,Yeah it's Jones.
Thank you. I do have your account pulled up here. You stated that we were overbilling?,Yeah. You guys have taken double payments two months in a row.
Okay. What type of policy is being over billed? I see you have life and auto with us.,It's the auto policy.
Thank you for that information.,You're welcome.
And just to confirm you were double charged in July and June?,Actually it was June and May. July hasn't come out yet.
Okay. What I will need to do is open a claim with our billing department so they can research the issue.,What? This is ridiculous. Why can't you just fix it?
I'm sorry sir. I can definitely understand your frustration. The billing department is going to be the best resource to solve the issue. We do not have as much access to systems as they do.,Fine.
So I have opened a case with them and let them know that you have been overbilled for the months of May and June and we would like to have it solved before your billing period in July. Is that correct?,Yes.
Great. I have the claim number whenever you are ready sir.,Fine. What is it?
One two three four five six seven eight.,Okay and how long until I hear from someone?
They usually respond the next business day sir.,Fine. Will they call me or email me?
Generally they contact you by phone unless you request otherwise.,Well I'd prefer them email me.
Okay sir. We have your email as Jason dot Brown at gmail dot com. Is that correct?,Yes.
I have updated the claim to show you prefer email as a contact method. You should be receiving a confirmation email shortly. Can you confirm that you got it?,Let me check.
Be sure to check your spam folder as well.,It's there. I got it.
Great. Was there anything else I could do for you today?,No.
Okay. There will be a brief survey after the call to rate your experience today if you'd like to participate.,Sure.
The survey will begin as soon as I disconnect.,Okay.
Have a great day sir. Goodbye.,Bye.
