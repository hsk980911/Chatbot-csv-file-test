"Thank you, mister Stuart. What is your date of birth?","yes October ninth, nineteen sixty seventy four."

"Okay, one moment please while I pull up your account.",Sure thing.
"Great, thank you. I have your account pulled up and I see your health insurance policy. I am showing you have three dependents?","Yes, that's right. I have two sons and one daughter."
"Okay, what is the first and last name of the dependent you are wanting to remove from your policy?","Yes, that's my son. His name is Mark Stuart."
