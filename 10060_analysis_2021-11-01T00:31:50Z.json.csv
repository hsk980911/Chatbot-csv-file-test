Why are you looking to cancel your policy?,Can you find me a cheaper plan?
Ok and is there anything I can do to keep you on this insurance policy?,I am just paying way to much right now.
Let me take a look.,Sure.
So currently you have a hundred thousand dollar liability policy and the deductible on that is five hundred dollars. This plan is costing you four hundred and thirty five dollars and twenty nine cents for six months.,Absolutly not! I am not having you track my driving. That is how the government is tracking people. I can't believe you support them.
We have a few different options that we could offer to lower your rates. Would you like to talk about them?,I want to cancel my plan. I don't want to work with you. Can I just do this online?
The first option would be to up your deductible to one thousand dollars. That would bring your policy down twenty dollars a month. Or we could install a device to track your driving habits for six months and that would lower your monthly rate as well.,Is that hard?
