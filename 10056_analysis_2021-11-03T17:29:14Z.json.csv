Well that's great news! I'm happy to hear you have a healthy baby.,Thank you me too. He's been great so far.
Good to hear. I've gone ahead and added him to your policy. It looks like your rates will only increase by three hundred twenty two dollars per year.,Okay. When does that go into effect?
Let's see. This should be effective starting today and will be in effect until your policy ends or unless you remove him as a dependent.,Okay. is there any way to do this online so I don't have to call in the future?
Yes sir. You should be able to do it by logging into your account at w. w. w. dot rivertown insurance dot com.,Okay that sounds good. We plan on expanding our family more so that'll be helpful to know for the next time I need to add someone.
Perfect! It should be an easy process. You'll select edit policy from the upper left hand corner when you log in and just follow the prompts to add a dependent.,Sounds easy enough. Do I owe anything today?
No sir. There is no change to your bill as of right now.,Okay.
Was there anything else I can do for you today?,"I don't think so. Oh! Yes, when will I get new cards for my son?"

I'm not entirely sure. I'm checking now.,Okay.
