"Rivertown Insurance, this is Michael.","Hi Michael, how are you today?"
I'm fine. How are you doing?,"Great, thank you for asking."
What can I do for you today?,I'm hoping to get proof of my car insurance.
"Sure, I can do that for you.","Great. I lost my wallet, which is where I usually keep it."
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.,Guess I should keep a copy in my car.
"Well, I can certainly help you get one.",Thanks.
"But let's start with some information from you, sir.",Okay.
Can I get your full name?,Yeah sure. Nick Jones.
And your date of birth?,"#Uh May fourteenth, nineteen eighty seven."
"Thank you, sir. And your customer number?",Oh I don't know. Where can I find that?
Well if you have a paper copy of a billing statement.,I don't.
Okay ,I think I have the paper option turned off.
That's okay. Do you use the website or the app?,"Yeah, both."
On the website it'll be the eight digit number under your name.,Oh okay.
Then on the app it's available under info on the side menu.,"Thanks, one second."
"Sure, sir.","I'm back. So, my customer number is four two four six eight nine two three."
And will you answer a security question for me?,Sure.
What is your mother's maiden name?,It's Smith.
Okay sir. Thank you. Can I also get your policy number?,#Uh I'm on the website. Where is that?
"It'll be another eight digit number, but it will be on the summary page for your policy specifically.","Oh, okay. #Uh that one is six two two nine, four four seven one."
"Thanks, mister Jones. And I see you're signed up for our Complete Auto plan, correct?","Yep, that's right."
Okay. So you have two options for receiving your proof of insurance.,Oh yeah?
"Yes, I can either mail you a physical copy or email it to you.",Is there a difference between them?
Not at all.,And would I just print the digital one myself?
"Yes, it might be a more convenient option for you.",Do you know if I can just show a picture of it on my phone when necessary?
"#Ah I'm not sure on that. It might be better to have a physical copy, regardless.","Yeah, true. I guess it'd depend on the circumstances."
"Right, probably.","If it were mailed, what's the turn around time on that?"
#Ah it would arrive in three to seven business days.,And does it cost me anything? A fee or shipping?
"No sir, it's a free service we provide.","Huh. You know what, let's go with a digital copy. Then I can just print several right away."
"Okay, sir, we can do that.",Thanks. I just don't want to wait for one in case something happens before I get it.
I totally understand. Let me get this request set up.,Sure.
"Can you confirm your email address for me, sir?",It's mike.c.jones at youmail dot com.
"Got it, sir. The request is in and that email should be sent very soon.","Okay, thanks."
You're welcome.,"I did check on the website, but I didn't see an official copy there."
"Right. Sorry about that, we always generate an up to date copy when requested.","Oh, okay."
"If you look under tools next time, though, there's a request button.","Oops, must have missed that."
It'll just confirm your email and send you a copy.,I should've looked harder. Sorry for wasting your time calling.
"It's no problem at all mister Jones, I'm here to help.",I appreciate that.
"If that email doesn't arrive within a few hours, just give us a call back.","Actually, I think I got it."
"Oh, good.",Hang on a second.
"Okay, sir.","Yep, I have it now."
That's great!,Thank you again for your help.
"Of course, mister Jones. Is there anything else I can do for you today?","No, I think that covers it."
Well thank you for calling sir.,Sure.
And if you're willing to remain on the line there'll be a short survey regarding your service today.,"Oh okay, yeah I can do that."
"It'll ask who helped you, so just a reminder my name is Michael.",Okay Michael. I'll be sure to give you a good review. .
"Thank you, mister Jones.",No problem. Thanks again. Have a good one.
"You too, sir. Bye now.",Bye.
