agent,customer
Rivertown Insurance. Good afternoon. This is Monica. How are you doing today?,"Hello, good afternoon. I've always tried to reach the call centre but theyv'e always placed me on hold for so long that I lose my patience and hangup without getting to talk to anyone.."
"Oh, I'm so sorry about that. We get so many queries, so most of our agents are usually busy, attending to our numerous customers. We are so sorry. Can I know your name, please? But before that, I would like to inform you that this call is being recorded to help us optimize our services to you.","Wait no, you guys also record calls? Is there even any privacy in this country anymore? Why's everyone."
#Err we are sorry if this feels like your privacy is being intruded. It's just standard procedure for.,"That's what you all say. Standard procedure, for what exactly, please?"
"#Um so the conversations we have with our customers are actually recorded for our dispensation to your requests to be assessed. I can assure you the recordings are used strictly for that purpose. #Uh our company holds it's customers and their interests in high esteem, so be assured we wouldn't do anything to jeopardize your privacy Sir.","Hm, that's a bit convincing."
"Yes Sir. So can I know your name, please?",I'm Matt.
"Oh nice to meet you, Matt. #Um how are you doing today?","Well r better, now that I have someone to attend to me."
"Oh great, that's great. That's why we are here. So what can I do for you, Matt?","So initially, when I was trying to get to you guys last week, I just wanted to change my address."
Okay?,"Yeah, but now I would like to cancel one of my plans too."
"Alright if I get you correctly, you would like to change the address on your file, and also cancel one of your plans?",Exactly what I just said. I would like to change my address and cancel one of the plans I'm subscribed to.
"Alright, that's not a problem Sir. So here's what we're going to do. We take it step by step, beginning with the change of address, then we move to cancel the plan you wish you to cancel, okay?","Okay. #Uh what details do I need for my change of or in short, what is involved for the change of address?"
"Yeah r so first, I'm sure you're effecting the change because you have either moved to a new address or you plan to do.","Yeah, yeah, I'm moving with my family to Tenesse next week."
Oh great. Tennesse is wonderful.,"Yeah, yeah, I'm actually moving for job reasons. I just got a job over there, so I have to move for ease. And that's because "
"Oh okay, great.",What?
"No no, continue please.","#Uh alright, I was just saying that wait, you know what? I should not bore you with all these details. So I'm moving to Tenesse next week, yeah."
"Oh no, it's fine. But yeah, that's great, so I'm just going to ask a few questions to verify your identity, and then we effect the change to reflect your new address.",Okay then.
"So can I have your full name, that is, your first name and your last name in that order, and your date of birth as well.","#Uh my first name is Matt and my last name is Gregory. Sorry, I forgot the other question. I think you were asking "
Your date of birth.,"Yeah, yeah, thanks. My date of birth. I was born on the eight of March, nineteen seventy-five, alongside my twin, Mattias."
"Oh I see. That's good to know. #Err so right now, I need your customer number.","My customer number? Isn't it that eight-digit number? I do not have it here, but let me see if I can recall it. It should be "
"Oh, you don't have to stress. You could just check the Welcome Email that was sent to you when you newly created your account with us. The details are there.","Okay, let me check the wait, could you hang on a second? I think the mail's part of those my son mistakenly wiped recently. It's been causing me lots of trouble since I lost those emails, because I have a lot of vitals there, asides even this. Is there like a way we could work around this, because I do not even know where the last mail copy I got from you is at the moment."
"Oh so sorry about that. But yeah, it's not a problem if you cannot access the email anymore. You could just give me your phone number, your SSN and the answer to your security question instead.","Uh-oh! I have to provide these much details just to confirm I own the account? #Um wait, can't I just do this myself on the portal?"
"#Err yeah, but that's because we cannot get your customer number at the moment. It would have been easier with that. And yeah, you can do it yourself, but it's still the same procedure there too.",Oh really. Well r my phone number is four six nine.
Mhm?,five five five.
five five five?,six zero seven four.
"Okay, great. So your phone number is four six nine five five five six zero seven four?",Yap.
"Okay, great now your SSN?",That's r four four nine zero two.
You said four four nine zero?,"No, I said zero two."
"Okay, I got it. #Err you can go on with the rest.","#Um I stopped at r zero two? Okay yeah, that's where I stopped, then six nine two eight."
That's six nine two eight?,Yap.
"Okay, great. Alright, so now, can you tell me the answer to your security question, please?","#Err I guess that was Dan? Yeah, it was Dan."
"Perfect! Now that we are done verifying your identity, I'll need the full addresses, both the old and new to effect the change.",Like you need me to call out the old and new addresses to you?
"Yeah exactly, so we can effect the change, as you requested.","Whew! Okay. I'm currently staying at one forty-eight B, Hillcrest Road, Dallas, Texas, which will be the old address. Did you get that?"
"Yeah, r you said one forty-eight B, Hillcrest Avenue, Dallas, Texas, right?","No no no, not Avenue, I said Hillcrest Road."
"Oh, my bad. I'm sorry. I probably heard you wrong. Alright, that has been corrected, so your new address, please?","Hm, so I'll be moving to three twent-four Laurent Road."
Laurent Road.,"Yeah, Nashville, Tennesse."
"Perfect! So your new address in your file will now reflect three twenty-four, Laurent Road, Nashville, Tennesse.","Great, thank you."
"Yeah, you're welcome. So you mentioned you wanted to cancel one of your plans?","Yeah, yeah, I want to cancel."
"Okay, which one of them do you wish to cancel, because I can see here you're subcribed to the Homeowner and Automobile plans.","Yeah, I would like to cancel the car plan."
"Oh, the automobile plan? Alright, May I know your reason for cancelling, please?","I r so I-I thought about, like I heard about this you know what? I think I'll I should discuss with Annie what she thinks before I cancel. #Err sorry, Anita is my wife, and I just had a second thought about cancelling and realized I had not even informed her just yet about the cancellation, so I think I should inform her first. Thank you, and sorry for bothering you."
"#Ah, not a problem at all Sir. Take your time please.","Okay, great. Thank you. But r so if I'd eventually cancel, what do I need to do? Do I have to call back, or is it something I can do on the portal myself?"
"#Err you might actually have to call us back, as the self plan cancelling feature is currently disabled on the portal Sir.","Whoa! Really? Your mode of operation is so outdated. I literally have to call you for ever ything, and it's not like you're always available to answer. So annoying!"
"We are sorry for the discomfort Sir. We actually had the feature enabled before, but you know, it was disabled as we noticed some customers who are not so tech-oriented would mistakenly cancel a plan and would call us, complaining about we suddenly cancelling their plans. So we disabled to avoid such occurrences. We are actually currently working on a lasting solution to that, but until then, you may have to call us to help with plan cancellation and a few other things. And about the.",Well I guess we have to get used to waiting long on the phone for long to be attended to then.
"#Err About the availability, like I said earlier, please understand that we have many agents tending to the unending needs of our numerous valued customers, so you might experience r a slight delay. But please note that we take our time to attend to all our customers, without leaving any query unanswered, so if you cannot wait for the queue on the phone, you may just leave us an email, and we will definitely respond.",I guess the email option does it for me.
"Great, great. We are always glad to help.",Mhm.
"Is there any other question you would like to ask, or is there anything you would like me to do for you?","Nah, thanks. I just asked everything I needed to ask."
"Okay, great. Please, should you have any questions in the future or anything you would like us to help you with, please, feel free to reach us here, or you could drop an email, we will respond as quickly as possible.","Hm, alright."
"Okay, so mister Matt, thank you for being our valued customer. We hope to continue serving you.","Yeah, thanks."
Do enjoy the rest of your day.,You too.
"Okay, bye.","Yeah, bye."
