Thank your for calling Lily's Pet Palace. This is Lily how can I help you?,Wait is this the owner Lily?
[Laughter] No I just happen to have the same name though. Good catch!,You must get that a lot with the same name.
"I do, but all depends on the day.","Anyway I am looking to get some pet insurance, but I am looking around and have a few questions then want to figure out the total."
I would love to help you with that. Just so I know who I am talking to what is your name?,Janice.
Thank you and Janice just in case the call drops what is a good phone number I can reach you on?,Seven six three two oh eight three one nine nine.
Ok that was seven six three two oh eight three one nine nine.,Yes.
Alright so tell me a little bit about your pet.,Well I just got a kitten and he is eight weeks old.
How exciting. I am so excited for you! Boy or girl?,It is a boy.
Aww what's his name?,Garfield.
I love it! Is he orange and fluffy like Garfield?,No he is actually more orange and white with long fur.
So cute I bet he is just adorable.,Yeah he is. But I have a few questions for you before we go on.
Sounds good. What do you got?,What kind of plans do you have?
We offer two different types of plans Petcare Basic and Petcare Preferred.,What is the difference?
"Lets talk about the basic first. What that is, is a basic pet insurance it does have a network, so you would have to go to an in network vet. There is a six month waiting period before the plan kicks in. It does cover annual wellness visits and immunizations. It also covers eighty percent of prescriptions for your pet. With this plan it does pay for illness and incidents up to two thousand dollars, with a thousand dollar deductible.",Ok how much is that plan?
That plan would be five hundred dollars a year.,What about the other plan you talked about?
"That one is the Preferred plan and it includes the wellness visits once a year with immunizations. There is no network, so as long as they will bill us, so just make sure they take this plan. There is no waiting period, so you can take Garfield in right away. It also covers neutering at no cost to you. The amount it covers for illness and incident is three thousand dollars with a thousand dollar deductible.",That one sounds a lot better. It must be way more expensive?
"Actually that one is only one thousand dollars a year, so not to much more when a neuter costs a few hundred dollars itself.",Yeah you are true. Hmm I I think I would like to sign Garfield up for that.
"Perfect! Let me get some information for you, so I can get your account all set up and get Garfield some insurance.",Ok.
