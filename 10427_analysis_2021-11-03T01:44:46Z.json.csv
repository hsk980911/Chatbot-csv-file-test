This is Craig Brum speaking of Rivertown Insurance. How can I help you today?,Hello Craig. This is Garland. Where is Timothy?
Timothy is out in the field today. You get me. #Uh I got a few bruises on the back of my head crawling around in an attic and then.,You don't say Craig. What happened?
The Lady had mentioned noises in the attic so I assumed it was the duct work rattling. Nest of cliff swallows took flight at my poking around. Thought it was a rabid bat. So I forgot about the attic ceiling incline and the back of my head met roof heaven.,"Are you insured, Craig?"
Yep Garland I am insured and pay the same rates you do.,"I need to file a claim, Craig. Storm did some roof damage, knocked a large tree down."
Let us get your policy pulled---.,Number one two three dash four five six seven dash eight nine one zero. Had ready for you.
Got it. Garland Raewald. Is that you?,The one and only in this town.
Either I or Timothy will come take a look. #Uh pulling up the online form to get the process started. Give--.,"You ready for the rest yet, Craig."
"Yep, yep give me the address.",Eight one ten Main Street.
Got it. Tell me what happened and where you think what you know about the damage.,That front came through day before yesterday Craig. Regular like thunderstorm. I was in the house when wind came straight down out of the sky. I mean straight down from the clouds and rattling happened.
Mhm. Go on Garland.,Well ran to the back door and saw pieces of something flying off the house. It only lasted about six minutes. Not loud but fierce. Then cracking and snapping the backyard tree toppled over.
No roaring like a train or gurgling of drain pipes?,#Uh nothing like that. Did a frog strangular rain for a bit. It all stopped. Stepped out back saw some pieces of shingles on the ground. Now that was before the tree fell. Tree about eight feet up at the y split nearly in half and laid over. No twisting.
Your home is not the only one with damage. No reports of tornados Garland but of microbursts.,Microbursts what is that?
"It's a flow out, Garland. Cold air falls out of the cloud direct and just splats the ground. The tree description fits the pattern of a microburst. Now twisted but like stepped on.",Is that something new from climate change?
Nah. Just did not have a name for it before. We use to just call it tornado.,"You lied to me in your early years, Craig. ."
Not intentionally. We did not have a name for it and policies were written with word tornado.,Show up for dominoes at church next Saturday and all forgiven.
Hmm okay okay Garland.,Fred died Craig. Don't you read the obits? Looking for temporary players.
Let's get back to the property claim before I have to confess every sin.,Any good ones?
Plenty tell you at dominoes.,I did not crawl on the roof but stood on a big branch of the tree. Roof mostly there a few tiles missing with some having the edges turned up. Policy said not to be touching or fixing things before talking to you Craig.
Any leaks inside the house?,Did not see any on the ceiling. No puddles on the floor. Tree missed electrical lines. May be some fence damage but do not know till it is chopped up a bit. Do I get money for the tree?
Your homeowners policy covers wind damage and that's what a microburst is. Roof covered and coming out will determine if replacement or repair. Looking at the tree information so is the fence if damaged. Could you get out your back door easily?,The tree fell near the house with some branches brushing. Had to wade through a few branches once I opened the door but nothing major.
Have to take look Garland. If the the tree ruffled the roof then it is covered. If the tree had rot then it's not. You saw tiles coming off the roof you said.,"Pieces of shingle, Craig."
"They off the front of the house, Garland?",No the back.
We'll have to take a look. Noise may have been the branches rubbing on the roof after the splitting. So no promises but based on cause and effect scenarios. How old is the roof?,About ten years old no about nine years old.
Garland things in insurance often are pro-rated so all that factors in but at this point you will get something just cannot estimate what.,Do I go ahead and hire someone?
"I have a list of vendors, Garland that we recommend. Or you can find one. Need about three estimates on your own. Ours they are told what it will be.",Let's go with your list Craig.
"Okay Garland. Can we come out this afternoon, take a look and make some measurements?",Works for me Craig. Be back home around two this afternoon. Have to go the VFW.
See you at two Garland.,Bye Craig.
