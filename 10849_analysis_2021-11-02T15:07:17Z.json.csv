Well hello Tom! how may I help you?,"#Er I recently got another pet for our daughter so now I have to make vet visits for three, obviously that would be expensive."
"Mhm most likely , were you looking to sign up for one of our petcare plans mister Fabrino or.","Uh-huh, actually I already have one of the pet plans but I was thinking about upgrading, is there another tier for this plan?"
First I'll need some of your information so I can see your existing plan.,Yep Yep.
"Alright mister Fabrino, first name Tom right?",Yep.
Could you spell the last name for me please?,F.a.b.r.i.n.o.
"F.a.b.r.i.n.o, got it thank you.",My date of birth is December thirteenth nineteen ninety eight.
"Oh thank you, do you know your customer number mister Fabrino?",#Uh no? where can I find that?
You can find your customer number on the website if you login and.,Eee is there another way to verify? my internet is down right now actually .
I'm very sorry about that.,Huh no problem!
But yes if you can't access your customer number I could also verify using your phone number and social.,"Yay that's good, well you can see my number right?"
"#Um yes sir, so to confirm the number on file is four seven three, seven seven seven, eight six five four, yeah?",Yep that's it you got it!
"Great, now I just need your social security number, do you know it?",Mhm I'm pretty sure it's eight two three s-seven four three four seven zero I think.
"Eight two three seven four three four seven zero, is that correct mister Fabrino?",#Uh actually can I go check real quick I'm not sure?
Of course.,"Got it here, what was the number I told you?"
Eight two three seven four three four seven zero.,"#Ah I'm sorry I got the last two numbers wrong it's actually six three, my bad."
"No problem at all sir, to confirm- eight two three seven four three four six three.",Yep.
Okay mister Fabrino I see your account here I see you have multiple plans with us.,Uh-huh.
And you would only like to change your petcare plan right?,Mhm yeah pretty sure at least for now .
Wonderful well the current plan you are under is the Petcare Basic plan.,Uh-huh.
"The other petcare plan we offer is our Petcare Preferred plan, as a fluffy owner myself I can agree on the name .",Oh you have a dog too Jen?
Yeah I do it's a German Shepard! So Cute! .,Whoa I have a German Shepard too that's crazy! Great dog. .
For sure! So are you considering an upgrade from Petcare Basic?,Mhm could you explain the differences between the two?
Of course! The rate for your current plan the Petcare Basic is five hundred dollars a year.,Uh-huh and what's the rate for the Petcare Perfect plan?
"The Petcare Preferred plan, yes, that plan is one thousand dollars a year.","Jeez, I wasn't expecting that much."
"Mhm, the double in yearly price is because your benefits too are essentially doubled.","#Hm, what are my benefits anyways?"
With your current plan there is a restricted amount of vets and clinics where your benefits apply and obviously covers less.,Uh-huh that makes sense.
"Currently you'd be insured for minor injuries, accidents, and minor illness as well as covering some prescription medications.",Uh-huh.
"By upgrading you would keep these same benefits and gain coverage for emergency care, major injuries or illness and.",Huh so if one of the pups needed surgery for some reason.
"Yep that would be covered under the Preferred plan, it would also cover the higher end tier prescriptions that vets offer.",Whoa that's pretty nice.
"I agree and with your growing furry family I would recommend the higher coverage, you can never be too safe!","#Hm this is all sounding good, how long would it take to get my plan changed and all that?"
I can change your plan right now mister Fabrino all I need is for you to answer some security questions for me is that alright?,Yep sounds good.
What was the name of the high school you attended?,Febree Louis High.
And what was the name of your favorite teacher?,Miss Kabrini mhm.
Alright all good on my end for the upgrade I just wanted to confirm your change to the Petcare Preferred plan.,#Uh yeah go ahead!
Sure thing give me just a second to complete the process.,Go ahead.
"Okay your all set mister Fabrino, you should expect your new insurance cards in the next one to two weeks.",Yay.
