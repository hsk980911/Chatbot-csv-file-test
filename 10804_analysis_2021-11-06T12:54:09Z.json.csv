agent,customer
"Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance, this is Sage.",Good morning! I am just calling to-to check on something.
"Yeah, yeah. I can help you with your account. Can I get your name please?",My name is Sharon.
"#Um, your full name please.",Oh! Of course!
"No problem. It's early, right? .","Yes, still waking up. Need more coffee. My name is Sharon Muller."
Muller?,"Yes, that's spelled m-u-l-l-e-r."
Okay. Great. And let's see-I'll need your phone number and policy number.,My policy number? I don't think I have that handy.
"Well, let's start with the phone number for now.","My phone number is four-three-five, five-six-one, four-nine-three-six."
"Okay, and let me look at- what we need to verify your account. It looks like if you don't have the policy number we're gonna need your social and birthdate?","#Um, okay. I guess I should have been prepared. What do you want first?"
Let's do birthday.,"My birthday is September seventeeth, nineteen seventy-nine."
"Got it. Okay, and the social?",It's four-four-four-.
Yeah.,"Three-two, ninety-five."
"So thats, four-four-four, three-two, nine-five?","Yes, that's it."
"Great. Thanks for verifying your account, Sharon. So it looks like you have a Basic Home and Basic Auto insurance policy? Does that sound right?",Yes. That's what I remember it being.
"So, what can I do for you today?","I'm actually just wondering if there's a balance on my account? I was pretty sure I was supposed to get a bill for the next six months, but I'm afraid I might have missed it?"
According to this you're not due to-to pay the next bill until September first?,Oh! I thought it was August first-tomorrow. That's why I was concerned.
"Yeah, yeah. No problem. You still have another month.","Oh, that's great! Okay. And I'm still signed up for paper bills, right?"
Yeah. Says here you prefer paper billing. Would you-would you want to maybe change that?,To what?
"Well, we offer autopay? So you can hook up a credit card or banking account number and the money just comes right out automatically.",Oh! That does sound easier. That way I wouldn't worry. About missing the payments.
Yes. The majority of our customers prefer paperless billing. And it cuts down on paper waste too. If that's important to you.,"Well, I mean, it doesn't hurt, right?"
Yeah. Definately.,"I really should do more recycling. My city gives us this recycling garbage can, but honestly sometimes I forget what I can put in it ."
"Oh, yeah. I probably fill my recycling can fuller than my regular garbage.",Seriously?
"Oh, yeah. I mean, we get so many boxes and stuff. With like, Amazon?","Yes, I do too."
Just break those down and put them in. It's nice to have more space in the other garbage.,I really need to just take a minute and look up what counts and what doesn't. I know styrofoam doesn't.
"Oh, yeah. No styrofoam. And nothing dirty? Like, you can't put in a dirty pizza box. It's gotta be clean.",That's good to know!
"Yeah, I was surprised. I guess they just have to throw the whole can in the dump if you don't follow the rules, so be sure to look it up.","I will, thank you."
"No problem. So, do you want to change to autopay?",Yes. Let's go ahead and make things easier on me .
"Sounds good. So, do you wanna use credit or an account?",Let's go with a credit card.
"Okay, great. Let me just get to the right screen here-.",I'll pour myself some more coffee. Might need it in order to get my brain going here .
"Sounds good. Okay, so do you have your card ready?",Oh! Let me go grab my purse.
No problem. I'll hold.,I'm back. Sorry about that?
"Yeah, no worries.","Okay, so it's a Costco Card. Is that okay?"
"Of course. So, a Visa?",Yes. So here goes the number.
Great.,"It's five-two-five-six-seven, two-."
Uh-huh.,Two-nine-nine-two-six-.
Mhm.,Six-two-five-three-three.
"Great. And, what's the expiration date?",Looks like it's September of twenty twenty-three.
Okay. And now the CVV code?,"Remind me, is that the-."
the three digit number on the back?,"Oh! It's on the back, that's right. I always forget. Okay. So it's six-two-six."
Thanks for the info. It looks like we have your card all set up.,Wonderful!
You're next bill of eleven hundred dollars will be due-.,"Wait, eleven hundred? I thought it was a thousand-something."
"#Um, yeah, it's the same thing. One-thousand one-hundred-.",Oh! My cloudy brain. I thought you meant eleven thousand. I was panicking .
"Oh yeah, that would be quite the insurance policy. Like, you had six teenagers on your auto or something.",Teens cost that much?
"I was just kind of kidding. It does increase things, but not by like, that much.","Sure, sure. So the next bill will still be August first?"
"Yes, and it will automatically be withdrawn from your Visa. You'll receive an email reminder of the autopay, and also a recept for the transaction. Is your preferred email still the mullercats at one two three dot com?",That's right!
"Okay, I think you're all set then.",Thanks so much for the help! You just made my life so much easier .
"Any little bit helps, right?",That's right.
"Well, thanks for calling Rivertown. Is there anything else you need help with? Any questions?",No. I think I'm good for now. Might call another day to learn more about your pet insurance?
"Oh, yeah. Do you want to hear about our plans?","#Um, I really need to get going. I'm late for work, so- not now, but I might call back later in the week."
Great. I'll just make a note here that you're interested.,Thank you!
"Hey, no problem. Have a good day.",You too. Bye!
