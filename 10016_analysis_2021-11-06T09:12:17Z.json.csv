agent,customer
Thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance. My name is Lisa. To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with?,Kim Brown.
Thank you miss Brown. What can I help you with today?,I'm an idiot and thought I could remember my password but apparently I can't. I believe it locked me out because I tried too many passwords.
"I see. I can definitely help you with your password but first can I get your full legal name, date of birth and policy number?","Yeah, it's Kimberly J Brown. Date of birth is April first nineteen ninety."
"Wonderful. Do you have the policy number handy? If not, I can look it up by your social.","#Um, maybe. Can you hang on a second?"
Of course. Take your time.,"Okay, here it is. seven two two one forty-two sixty-sx."
"Ah, I found you. Yes, it does appear that you have been locked out of your account.",It's so hard to remember since you are supposed to use different passwords for different things. You know what I mean?
Oh yes. I have to write everything down these days.,I seriously need to start.
"I am going to reset your password now. It will take just a few moments. Other than your password issue, how is your day going?","Just fine. Busy. Ugh, it's just so hot outside, too. Are you in Florida also?"
"No, we are here in the great state of Texas. But yes, the heat here is nearly unbearable. At least we don't have the humidity you do, I feel for you.","I know, right?"
"I can't even imagine. I would melt before noon. Good news, miss Brown! It seems that the reset of the account was successful. Now you will need to enter your user name and the temporary password -","Hang on. Let me get back to that page. I'm sorry, my computer is really slow today."
I completely understand. It's okay.,#Um okay! So I put in my user name and then what?
I will give you a temporary password so you can get into your account. The system will then prompt you to create another secure password.,Perfect. I'm ready.
The password is rivertownkb.,"Okay, all lowercase?"
Correct. I will wait on the line to make sure you don't have any trouble.,Thanks.
Of course! Let me know when you are in.,#Huh for some reason it isn't working.
What type of error message are you receiving?,"Oh, it says incorrect username. Hang on a minute, let me see."
Okay. Let me know if you need help.,"Oh, you know what? It autocorrected my username. Let me fix it."
Sounds good.,Yes! I'm in!
Wonderful. Did the prompt to create a new password come up?,"Yeah, I'm doing it right now."
Awesome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?,I don't think so. But I better right down this password right now before I forget.
Sounds like a wonderful idea. Just be sure to keep it in a secure place.,I'll create a secret hiding place.
Perfect. Have I answered all of your questions?,Oh yes. You are wonderful. Thank you.
