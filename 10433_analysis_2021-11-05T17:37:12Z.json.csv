"So Miss Ruby, let me go over the types of life insurance we have.",I'm interested in Whole Life insurance.
"We'll, Miss Ruby, I can go over details of our Whole Life insurance policy with you.",Sure.
Whole life insurance is permanent Life insurance meaning the policy never expires or ends unlike Term Life Insurance policies.,Yes and that's why I've made the decision to go with the whole life insurance even though the term offers more money for my love one's.
"You're right, it does offer less pay out and is a little more expensive than Term but usually Term life insurance only covers a minimum number of years while Whole is for a lifetime.",Right.
And another reason to get Whole Life Insurance is because there's cash value in an Whole life insurance policy.,#Oh really!
"Yes, you can borrow from the cash value of this type of insurance after it has accumulated enough value.","#oh, thank you for that information, I didn't know that."
"We'll first, let me go over the pricing and the fees.",Okay.
Let me see what type of life insurance payout range are you thinking about.,"I have a husband and children and hope to live long enough to have grandchildren, so I was thinking around one hundred thousand dollars."
"We'll, hold on Miss Ruby while I calculate some numbers.",Okay.
"Hello, I'm back.",Okay.
"So you're fourty one years old and are you in pretty good health, I mean go to the doctor pretty regularly and don't have any major health problems.","Yes, all of that is correct."
So our one hundred thousand dollar policy will cost you one hundred and twenty dollars a month or one thousand two hundred upfront for the whole year which will save you two hundred dollars.,Uh-huh okay.
"We can start the policy now, but there is a medical form that I will have to send you to verify that you are in generally good health.",Okay.
"Not great health, laughter, not to many of us are in great health but just pretty generally overall healthy with no major health problems.",Laughter.
"And who would you like to list as beneficiary of your policy, it can be anyone, and I will need their full name and address.",I would like to list my husband.
"Okay, his name?",Jerome Ruby.
Spell that for me please.,Jerome J E R O M E.
J E R O M E.,Yes. and Ruby is R U B Y.
