"Rivertown Insurance, how can assist you?",I need to cancel.
Cancel an insurance plan?,Yeah.
Okay I can help with that. What is your name and birth date?,Tamara New.
And your birth date?,seven two seventy three.
m I can't seem to find your account.,Oh I'm sorry seventy two not seventy three.
Your birthdate is seven two nineteen seventy two?,Yes.
Okay.,I'm trying to make myself younger .
That would be nice wouldn't it!,You bet it would!
Okay here you are. So I see you are currently enrolled in our home insurance plan.,Yes that's correct.
Would you like to consider changing to a different home insurance plan?,"No, I'm selling my house and moving to abroad."
Oh that sounds fun. What takes you abroad?,I have accepted a long-term job abroad.
Oh excellent. Okay well I can definitely start the process of cancelling your policy.,Thank you very much.
I just need to confirm your identity a little further. What is your mother's maiden name?,Johnson.
And the city you were born?,Atlanta.
Great thank you.,No problem.
Okay since you are in the middle of your policy unfortunately there is a cancellation fee.,Okay I understand. I expected that. How much is it?
It is the equivalent of one month's coverage so it will be one hundred dollars.,Oh that's a lot better than I thought it would be. So that's fine.
"Well I'm glad we are meeting our expectations with our customers, that's very important to us.",Y'all have been great. I would continue with your company if I wasn't selling my house.
We understand. But your new adventure sounds wonderful.,"Thank you, yes I hope it will be."
Okay so do you want to cancel your policy immediately?,is there anyway to transfer my policy to the new owners?
We can't just transfer it. We still need to cancel your policy and then they would have to start a new policy with us.,okay I see. Well then I'm not sure exactly when to cancel it because I'm not sure when it will sell.
Okay.,"I have a buyer but I'm not sure when everything will be completed, like paperwork wise and stuff."
Understandable.,So I'm not...
So what I would...,I'm sorry go ahead.
Oh no problem. So what I would do is we can start the process of cancelling and I can make a note in your acocunt that you will be cancelling the policy pending on the selling of your house. Then you can call in when you do know a specific date.,Okay that sounds good. So I'll continue to have my policy until I call in saying that the house has sold and I am for sure cancelling my policy?
Yes ma'am.,Okay that sounds doable. So I will call y'all at a later date then to officially cancel my policy.
Sounds great miss New. Can I help you with anything else today?,No thank you.
Okay well thank you for calling Rivertown Insurance and have a great day.,Thank you.
