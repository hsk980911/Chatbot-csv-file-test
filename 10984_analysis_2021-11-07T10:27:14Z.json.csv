Thanks for calling Rivertown! This is Charity. What's your name?,"Hi. #Um, it's Sam, Samantha."
"Samantha, what's your last name?",Miller.
Ok. Easy enough. Thanks. Your birthdate?,"July thirty first, two thousand."
Thanks. Two thousand.,#Mhm.
"And, to verify your account, what's the name of your childhood best friend?",Giles.
"Thanks for verifying. Now, I've got your account pulled up. How can I help?","Well, I got this email that says, well I get my payments, are made, they're automatic and I noticed the payment was higher than usualy, so I went online, and saw a weird charge."
Ok. How much was the charge?,Sixteen something.
Ok. I see that and it looks like that is for your renters policy.,I don't have renters insurance!
"#Uh-oh. That's not good. I show that you do, and you have auto.","Yes. Yes, that one's right, but I don't have renters."
Let me look into this. One moment.,#Mhm.
"Are you still there, Sam?",Yeah. I'm here.
"Ok, it looks like you called in last week and enrolled in renters insurance. Actually, it looks like you did it online. Does that sound familiar?","No, no, I only got a quote."
#Hm. It looks like you actually signed up. Is it possible that you accidentally signed up?,"#Oh, who knows. Your site isn't that easy to figure out, even for me."
"I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. I can stop the policy now, if you'd like.","Well, yes! I didn't sign up for it."
"Ok. Well, give me, just a moment and I will get this canceled.","I better not, will you refund the payment for that?"
"#Oh, I'm not sure I can do that. I'll need to put you on hold for a couple of minutes while I consult with my colleague.",Ok.
"One moment, please.",#Mhm.
"Ok, Sam?",I'm here.
Sorry for the wait. My supervisor says that we credit that to you on next month's bill.,You can't refund me?
"Unfortunately, because it was an automatic payment, we can't. I'm sorry.","I'm on a budget, you know."
"I understand, but I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do to process refunds. #Uh, we just can't process refunds for automatic payments.","Whatever. Fine. So, a credit next month?"
Yes. I'm working on that right now.,Fine.
"Ok. You're all set and I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, Sam.",Ok. Thanks.
Is there anything else I can do for you?,No. That's it.
Have a good day and thanks for calling Rivertown Insurance.,"#Yep. Thanks. You, too."
Thanks. Bye bye.,Bye.
