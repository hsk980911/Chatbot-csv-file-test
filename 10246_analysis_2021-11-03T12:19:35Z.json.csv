"Rivertown Insurance, Tammy speaking, how can I help you?",Hello I called Rivertown I'm sorry my brain is not working right now .
it's okay I completely understand.,I'm glad someone else understands me .
Absolutely .,I'm telling you this week has been so crazy I don't even know where I am.
Oh I completely understand believe me.,I'm sure you do! I bet calls have been crazy as well with so many people buying cars and home lately.
"There have definitely been a fair few calls, but totally manageable.",Oh that's good. Excellent. Okay so yeah sorry. I think I called Rivertown last week inquiring about an auto plan and I'd like to enroll in one.
Okay we can definitely do that.,Great.
Do you know which plan you want?,Well I'm considering two. The middle price one and higher price one.
The premium and exceptional plans?,Yeah I guess. I don't remember the names.
Well the premium plan is our middle price and coverage plan and the exceptional plan is our highest price and highest coverage plan.,So yes those two. What is the difference between the two.
So with the premium plan you get our full coverage insurance for up to two cars. With the exceptional plan you get our full coverage for an unlimited amount of vehicles as well as extended warranties.,Okay m. Well I only have one car so I'm thinking I don't need the exceptional. Can you remind me what the lowest price plan is?
Sure absolutely. That is our basic plan. It comes with the majority of our full coverage with some exceptions and covers one vehicle.,Okay m I just don't know. What would you suggest?
"Well you said you have one vehicle, correct?",Yes ma'am.
So I would suggest our basic or premium plans. And honestly I would suggest the premium plan because it gives you more coverage.,Yeah I guess be better safe than sorry right?
Yes exactly. I personally would rather have insurance and not use it than not have enough insurance when I need it.,Oh yeah absolutely that makes total sense. Okay so let's go with the premium plan.
Okay perfect. So now I need some personal information to enroll you in the plan.,Of course.
What is your first name?,Justin.
And last name?,Smith.
And Justin what make and model is your car?,It's a two thousand ten Nissan Altima.
And have you created an account with us?,I have. I did that when I called last week just in case.
Okay perfect. And Justin so you know your account number?,"Oh no, I don't remember that, I'm sorry."
No problem. What is your date of birth?,six twelve ninety-nine.
Okay I see your account here. So just to confirm you would like to enroll in the premium plan correct?,Yes ma'am.
Okay so you are now enrolled in the premium plan and should be receiving more information by email shortly about your account and payment information.,Alright sound good thank you so much.
You are very welcome. Can I help you with anything else?,No I think I'm good.
